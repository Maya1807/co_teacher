Some examples and suggestions are discussed in each area to help teachers in dealing with children with autism. It should be noted that each child with autism presents unique strengths and weaknesses, so not all these suggestions will be appropriate for all children with autism. The authors emphasize that the key is to learn as much as possible about children with autism from each child's IEP team. Teachers then, must be prepared to implement individually determined strategies to structure the environment, accommodate communication challenges, and prevent challenging behaviors.",

The text consists of 12 chapters, each concerned with a different school issue/structure. Chapter 1 outlines definitions of autism and attempts to illustrate how autism is experienced by individuals with the labels of autism, Asperger syndrome, and other related labels. Chapter 2 provides information on inclusive education and outlines the federal laws related to special education. Chapter 3 explores some of the values and beliefs that support the development of inclusive schools. The following chapter features voices of families and gives ideas for partnering with parents. Chapters 5 and 6 share specific strategies  for creating a positive, safe, and comfortable educational environment, and ideas for building classroom community. Chapter 7 illustrates different ways that student communication can be bolstered, and chapter 8 explores ways that educators can promote literacy development. Positive ways to support a range of behaviors are provided throughout chapter 9 and chapter 10 contains tools and structures to assist in lesson planning. The final two chapters provide classroom-tested ideas for teaching and suggestions for teacher collaboration and teaming. (Contains approximately 350 references.) (CR)",

      "abstract": "Children with autism spectrum disorders are increasingly being educated in inclusive general education classrooms. For optimal results, teachers need to know as much as possible about autism and the teaching methods and modifications that work best for these students. This is a huge undertaking for time-crunched general education teachers, many of whom may never have had a student with autism before. Now teachers can turn to \"Autism in Your Classroom\" for the information and guidance they need. Written by two neuropsychologists with extensive clinical and classroom experience, this new book is a concise, easy-to-read guide developed for primary school teachers (grades K-6). Part I provides a complete overview of the types, causes, characteristics, and treatments of autism spectrum disorders. It also explains various secondary characteristics of autism that create challenges for students, such as sensory abnormalities, behavioral issues, and limited social skills and peer interaction. Part II focuses on the student in the classroom: It covers a variety of strategies to manage learning & behavior, such as: Modifying classwork & homework; Helping with language difficulties; Using visual strategies; Keeping students focused & organized; Teaching reading & math; Using positive reinforcement & rewards; Handling challenging behavior; Explaining autism to other students; Teaching social skills in the classroom; Balancing the needs of typical and special students. Part III features two useful case studies. Both stem from the authors' hands-on work and consultation with teachers, students, and parents. The book concludes with an appendix of frequently asked questions about children with autism asked by educators.",

These challenges can manifest in the classroom, and there are a number of simple strategies for instructors that directly address characteristics of ASD. These strategies are not just good for students on the spectrum, but they can benefit other learners as well.",

The rate of diagnosis, combined with the trend towards more inclusive classrooms, means that general education teachers will most likely be teaching some students with ASD.

In conjunction, pre-service teachers received instruction on teaching strategies to use in the classroom for students with ASD. By combining good literature with instruction in inclusive teaching practices, teacher educators can model the use of disability literature in the classroom to the benefit of all students.",

There are many benefits to having inclusive classrooms, including reducing stigma surrounding autism, creating respectful relationships between all students within a classroom, teaching all students how to act positively with others, and increasing knowledge of autism. To best create an inclusive classroom, teachers should continue differentiating instruction, should teach to a student's interests and needs, and should meet with family members of students with autism to better understand the needs of the child. All students can benefit from being in an inclusive classroom setting, and teachers often already implement teaching strategies that would best support a child with autism.",

These teachers have had little to no training in either their teacher preparation nor-school based professional development programs in teaching children on the spectrum. The purpose of this paper is to explore teaching strategies that are successful for these children and can be easily implemented in the classroom. The research literature reveals little on this topic. There is information on early intervention with preschool students as well as environmental, communication, and social supports. Educators from general and special education were interviewed for their ideas and experiences in working with this population. Their information was analyzed and summarized to form a list of recommendations for classroom teachers. Results indicated that teachers are open to having students on the autism spectrum in their classroom. They appreciate formal training as part of their in- service opportunities. There are many strategies available to implement. These strategies address social, emotional and some academic supports. Teachers need to understand that with this population, their strategies may have inconsistent results, given the nature of the differences both between and among children.",

To compare the experiences of teachers dealing with students with ASD in different classroom environments. A total of 245 teachers filled out four self-report questionnaires measuring perceived stress, social support, coping strategies, and burnout. Specialized teachers perceive their teaching as a challenge, can count on receiving help from colleagues, use more problem-focused coping strategies and social support seeking behavior, and are less emotionally exhausted than teachers in regular classes. This study highlights that teachers in specialized schools and classes have better adjustment, probably due to their training, experience, and tailored classroom conditions.",

Evidence from the literature concerning the relative efficacy of hand-over-hand (self-modeling) in contrast to passive observational teaching techniques (e.g., video modeling) shows the theoretical and empirical basis of the suggestion that passive observation is preferable to other instructional strategies directed to these populations. We describe a classroom program that taught basic life skills, sign language, and printing letters to children with severe delays over a seven-year period using such video instruction.",

Strategies for addressing communication issues and motivational issues are discussed, along with appropriate instructional formats and positive behavior support.

The current study was informed by Florian and Spratt's Inclusive Pedagogy Framework and utilised an exploratory sequential mixed-method design to investigate Bhutanese teachers' knowledge and use of pedagogical strategies for the inclusion of students on the autism spectrum. Data was collected via semi-structured interviews (n = 16), classroom observations (n = 7) and online surveys (n = 106). The analysis revealed that although teachers reported their knowledge of effective inclusive strategies, they made limited use of them in their practice, which resulted in the micro-exclusion of students on the autism spectrum despite their physical placement in regular classrooms/schools. Recommendations for enhancing Bhutanese teachers' skills and capacity to implement effective strategies for including students on the autism spectrum are provided.",

This descriptive, qualitative study, embedded within an inclusive pedagogical approach, draws on a purposive sample of 13 elementary school teachers who have experience in teaching children with ASD within two cities in Ontario, Canada. Through in-depth interviews we asked about teachers' strategies for creating an inclusive environment within their classroom. Teachers had several recommendations for successfully including children with ASD in mainstream classrooms including: (1) advocating for resources and essential training; (2) tailored teaching methods; (3) teamwork within the school; (4) building a rapport with parents and students; and (5) building a climate of acceptance within the classroom through disability awareness, education and sensitivity training. In conclusion, teachers need to use several strategies and have appropriate training and resources to optimise the successful inclusion of children with ASD.",

Teacher ratings of intervention acceptability, effectiveness, and rate of change were compared across United States and New Zealand samples. Beliefs examined were personal teaching efficacy, general teaching efficacy, and pupil control ideology (PCI). Samples were compared regarding their preferences for the daily report card, response cost technique, classroom lottery, and medication as classroom strategies for managing ADHD-related behavioural concerns. Data were analysed using general linear modelling techniques, and an interaction was demonstrated between ADHD intervention x PCI x nationality. Differences were observed for ADHD interventions across samples based upon pupil control orientations. Implications for educators and their classroom practices are discussed.",

Given the negative consequences of ADHD, effective school-based interventions are warranted. School counselors are uniquely positioned to implement strategies for children with ADHD to maximize their capacity for learning. This article provides specific strategies that school counselors can provide collaboratively to enhance the academic and social functioning of children with ADHD in school.",

Chapter 1 discusses the search strategies developed to retrieve articles on early intervention in ADHD including practice guidelines; cases studies; difficulties with diagnosis in pre-school; and assessment procedures. Chapter 2 considers the prevalence, diagnosis, and assessment of ADHD in preschool children. Chapter 3 looks at the evidence for treatment  strategies as with parental behavior management; special classroom programs; social skills training; pharmacotherapy; and diet. Chapter 4 reviews assessments such as developmental assessment; parent-child interaction and family functioning; and functioning in other environments. Chapter 5 provides conclusions about management of ADHD in preschool children. (Contains 66 references.) (JDM)",

Participants were 110 U.S. teacher candidates enrolled in a student teaching internship course. Fall participants (intervention group; n = 69) received the specialized curriculum that focused on implementation of classroom management strategies for students with emotional and behavioral disorders and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), in concert with their internship; spring participants (comparison group; n = 41) did not. All participants completed pre- and postquestionnaires, which included measures assessing knowledge of classroom management principles, knowledge of ADHD, and self-efficacy. Measures of satisfaction with the curriculum were also collected. Fourteen teachers (seven intervention group, seven comparison group) participated in follow-up observations in their first teaching semester. Results demonstrate significant differences in knowledge of classroom management principles and ADHD between groups from pre- to postinternship, and high levels of participant satisfaction with the curriculum. Preliminary observations reveal greater use of evidence-based classroom management strategies in the intervention group. Implications for further program development and educator preparation as well as suggestions for future research are discussed.",

Unfortunately, general educators may not be prepared to provide supports for children with ADHD or other types of diverse learning needs. Children with ADHD have many unique characteristics that interfere with their learning and task completion. The largest group of children with ADHD has attention problems, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Their characteristics consist of the following: (1) Selective attention problems; (2) Sustained attention problems; (3) Impulsivity; and (4) High levels of verbal and motor activity. In this article, sticky notes, or adhesive-backed paper like Post-Its[R], and highlighters are used as support materials because they are present in most educational settings, inexpensive, easy to use, and portable so children can be taught to use similar strategies at home. The 20 strategies presented in this article were extrapolated from the literature on supports for students with learning problems and students with ADHD.",

Parents perceive accessing child psychiatric services as stigmatizing and prefer educational interventions for ADHD. There is a crucial need for research that restructures information and intervention paradigms about ADHD within a school context. The objectives of the present study were to understand teacher perspectives in relation to ADHD behaviours as they present in mainstream elementary classrooms. Located in Bangalore Urban district, India, the purposive sample consisted of teachers and students from the elementary section of 5 regular schools. Data was obtained through in-depth interviews, classroom observations and responses to vignettes. Responses were qualitatively analysed for themes and main concepts. Results indicate that teachers use a framework model to locate the construct of ADHD in a developmental context. ADHD behaviours are attributed to parent disciplining styles and environmental factors such as over exposure to electronic media. Teachers respond to classroom challenging behaviours using directive and heuristic strategies. The study highlights the need to recognize cultural complexities in understanding the ADHD construct.",

The current study examined teachers' knowledge and beliefs about ADHD, their self-reported use of evidence-based instructional and behaviour management strategies in the classroom, and the relationships between knowledge, beliefs, and classroom practices. It was expected that teachers would have a moderate amount of knowledge about ADHD, mixed positive and negative beliefs about ADHD, that they would regularly use less intensive evidence-based behaviour management strategies, and that more knowledge and positive beliefs about ADHD would be correlated with higher use of effective classroom practices. Web-based questionnaires were completed by 113 teachers from six school boards across Nova Scotia. Results indicated that the mean teacher knowledge score was ~68% and that they had more knowledge about symptoms/diagnosis of ADHD and less knowledge about general ADHD facts and about evidence-based treatments. Teachers had slightly more positive than negative beliefs about ADHD and reported occasional use of evidence-based instructional and behaviour management practices in their classrooms. There was a significant correlation between teachers' beliefs about ADHD and their use of evidence-based behaviour management practices, but there was no significant correlation between specific ADHD knowledge and classroom practices. Information gained from this study has implications for the content of ADHD teacher training and professional development programs as well as for school psychologists and those in teacher consultation roles.",

This article defines working memory, describes its importance to scholastic functioning, and highlights recent studies examining working memory functioning in students with ADHD. Finally, the authors discuss how educators can address working memory weaknesses in the classroom.",

      "abstract": "This practicum provided a 12-week group instruction program which was designed to enable 8 high school students with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) to gain knowledge about ADHD, implement strategies for coping with the disorder, and employ self-advocacy skills. The program involved administration of an ADHD measure prior to and following the intervention; administration of a learning strategies inventory; development of a list of classroom modifications which students discussed with their teachers; development of goal attainment sheets; selection of instructional materials; and interviews with individual students, parents, and 16 teachers. Data analysis indicated that students: (1) increased understanding of their ADHD; (2) increased understanding of individual  learning styles; (3) gained strategies to self-advocacy; and (4) selected modifications to address individual learning styles. It was concluded, however, that high school students need more than a 12-week group program to learn self-advocacy skills and strategies for coping with the disorder. Three appendices provide the goal contract used, a classroom modification checklist, and the ADHD pre/post-test. (Contains 20 references.) (DB)",

This information is important given increased attention and emphasis on universal and targeted strategies within problem-solving models in schools. Participants were teachers surveyed from 26 states across North America about their use of behavioral supports for their students with ADHD. Results are grouped by primary (K-2), intermediate (3-5), and middle (6-8) school levels. Results from this survey demonstrate that teachers report using significantly more universal and targeted strategies in the primary and intermediate school levels than teachers in the middle school level, revealing a reduction of behavioral supports for students with ADHD as they move into the middle school years. These findings have have implications for targeting school-based interventions for students with ADHD as they transition into middle school.",

      "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine if there is a significant difference in test scores on the Grade Five Reading State of Texas Assessment of Academic Readiness involving male and female students identified as having the characteristics of dyslexia who received early dyslexia intervention and those who received late dyslexia intervention, and whether improvement in test scores for these males and females depend on the timing of individual student dyslexia intervention. This research study was undertaken in one north central Texas suburban public school district. For the purpose of this study, early dyslexia intervention refers to the dyslexia intervention for students identified as having the characteristics of dyslexia in first, second, or third grade and who began to participate in a dyslexia intervention program upon identification. Additionally, late dyslexia intervention refers to the dyslexia intervention for students identified as having the characteristics of dyslexia in fourth or fifth grade and who began to participate in a dyslexia intervention program upon identification. The participants included 130 students who were identified as having characteristics of dyslexia and who were administered the Grade Five Reading STAAR test in one north central Texas suburban public school district during the May 2022 test administration. The participants included 91 students who received early dyslexia intervention and 39 students who received late dyslexia intervention, with the sample consisting of 78 male students and 52 female students. A two-way between subjects analysis of variance (ANOVA) was utilized to determine if there were significant differences in Grade Five Reading STAAR test scores between students who received early dyslexia intervention and those who received late dyslexia intervention, of male and female students, and whether test scores for males and females depend on the timing of individual student dyslexia intervention. Results of the study suggest that there was no significant difference in Grade Five Reading STAAR test scores between students who received early dyslexia intervention and those who received late dyslexia intervention, and also no significant difference existed between the scores of male and female students. Another key finding within this research study was that test scores for males and females do not depend on the timing of individual student dyslexia intervention.

      "abstract": "Research demonstrates that phonological skills provide the basis of reading acquisition and are a primary processing deficit in dyslexia. This consensus has led to the development of effective methods of reading intervention. However, a single phonological deficit is not sufficient to account for the heterogeneity of individuals with dyslexia, and recent research provides evidence that supports a multiple-deficit model of reading disorders. Two studies are presented that investigate (1) the prevalence of phonological and\u00a0cognitive processing deficit profiles in children with significant reading disability and (2) the effects of those same phonological and cognitive\u00a0processing skills on reading development in a sample of children that received treatment for dyslexia. The results are discussed in the context of implications for identification and an intervention approach that accommodates multiple deficits within a comprehensive skills-based reading program.",

We examined differences between second (n=122; early diagnosis) and third (n=158; late diagnosis) graders with dyslexia on reading and spelling abilities before, during and after a dyslexia intervention as well as in precursor measures. Scores were also compared with those of typical reading peers at second (n=108) and third (n=119) grade. Finally, we examined the role of second versus third grade diagnosis in the prediction of variation in responsiveness to intervention. Before the intervention, the early diagnosed group was behind the late diagnosed group on almost all measures. During the intervention, the earlier diagnosed group made more progress on word decoding accuracy and showed comparable progress in skills otherwise. The effect of the intervention was indicated from the fact that later diagnosed children before the intervention were behind earlier diagnosed children after the intervention--when at a comparable age--on all reading and spelling measures. Finally, we showed that an early or later diagnosis of dyslexia similarly predicts the growth of reading and spelling outcomes with only a small benefit of early diagnosis for pseudoword reading efficiency.",

Furthermore, we investigated to what extent the response to the intervention is robust across different cognitive profiles (phonological awareness, rapid automatized naming, and working memory). A group of 54 Dutch children, diagnosed with developmental dyslexia, received a phonics through spelling intervention that combined reading and spelling instruction and practice in a systematic way. An equal amount of time was spent on reading and spelling. Compared with norms within a normal population, positive effects were established for word and pseudoword reading efficiency and word spelling from pretest to posttest. The individual variation in phonological awareness, rapid automatized naming, and verbal working memory did not significantly influence the progress in reading and spelling children made during the phonics through spelling intervention. It can thus be concluded that a combined reading and spelling intervention is beneficial for word and pseudoword reading efficiency and word spelling in children with developmental dyslexia notwithstanding their cognitive profiles. Although promising results were found, this study also showed the persistence of spelling but even more so of reading problems after an intervention among children with dyslexia.",

We also took phonological awareness, rapid automatized naming, verbal working memory, and semantics into account. Results showed that children with dyslexia performed better in verbal learning and equal in verbal consolidation compared to typically developing peers. Regression analyses revealed that verbal learning did not predict reading but did predict spelling ability, across both groups; verbal consolidation did not predict reading, nor spelling. Furthermore, neither verbal learning nor verbal consolidation was related to responsiveness to a phonics through spelling intervention in children with dyslexia. Verbal learning may thus be seen as a compensatory mechanism for spelling before the intervention for children with dyslexia but is beneficial for typically developing children as well.",

The aim of this article is to draw on contemporary theory and research on reading development, reading difficulties, and reading intervention to describe what the authors believe are four key components of a definition of dyslexia/reading disability. They begin by discussing some preliminary factors that need to be considered in developing a definition of dyslexia. The authors then present the four components of their proposed definition, drawing on a framework for conceptualizing reading difficulties derived from the simple view of reading. They conclude by comparing their definition of dyslexia with the working definition put forward by the ministry. (Contains 1 figure.)",

      "abstract": "While developmental dyslexia has been extensively studied in children, research on adults is still rather limited. This paper aims to bridge the gap in existing research by presenting the findings of a study that examined the reading and spelling skills of adults with dyslexia and assessed the effectiveness of a linguistic intervention designed to improve their literacy abilities. To address this issue, we first compared the profiles of 44 adults with dyslexia (age range: 16-30 y.o.) and 44 age-matched typical readers across tasks assessing reading, spelling, phonological awareness, morphological awareness and lexical access in Italian. The findings underscored pervasive impairments in dyslexia across all measured dimensions, reaffirming the persistent nature of language and literacy challenges into adulthood. In pursuit of the second objective, the study explored the potential for literacy skill improvement in adults with dyslexia through the implementation of a specialized intervention proposed to 24 dyslexic adults and delivered via a web application. The intervention program yielded positive outcomes in the experimental group, demonstrating significant improvements in word and text reading, spelling, and speed of phonological elaboration. This study, hence, contributes not only to our understanding of developmental dyslexia in adulthood but also emphasizes the tangible benefits of targeted linguistic interventions, thereby offering practical implications for the amelioration of literacy skills in this population.",

      "abstract": "Great strides have been made in the development of effective methods of instruction for children with dyslexia. However, individual response to treatment varies, and weaknesses persist for some students with dyslexia despite otherwise effective instruction. Continued efforts are needed to support the prospective identification of poor response, particularly in routine intervention settings. The current study addressed whether indicators of dyslexia risk as outlined by hybrid diagnostic models predict response in children who received Tier 3 dyslexia intervention in their schools. The program's efficacy has been previously documented in remediating reading abilities in children with dyslexia. Data were examined from 115 elementary-age children who received routine Tier 3 dyslexia intervention in their schools. Logistic regression revealed powerful effects of preintervention fluency and gender in predicting response, with weaker effects of decoding and rapid naming. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder status also played a role in predicting response. Phonological awareness and listening-reading comprehension discrepancy did not predict response. Profile analyses indicated near- and far-transfer of skill for the adequate response group, whereas growth in the poor response group was limited to near-transfer. Findings support a continuum of severity that may be associated with less robust growth and generalization over the course of the intervention.",

      "abstract": "Despite the widespread use of Orton-Gillingham (OG) based approaches to dyslexia remediation, empirical support documenting its effectiveness is lacking. Recently, Chia and Houghton demonstrated the effectiveness of the OG approach for remediation of dyslexia in Singapore. As a conceptual replication and extension of that research, we report results of 39 students with dyslexia aged between six and 14 years enrolled in an OG intervention programme over a period of one year in a single-subject research (pre-test/post-test) design. Analyses of variance showed that students significantly improved in standardised tests of reading and spelling with moderate effect sizes (Cohen's d = 0.52-0.58). Additionally, an inverse relationship was found between students' ages when they began intervention and gains made during the intervention. Results thus indicate the effectiveness of an OG approach in remediating literacy difficulties in students with dyslexia and, taken together with previous studies, further suggest the importance of early identification and intervention.",

      "abstract": "Early access to evidence-based reading intervention improves outcomes for students with or at risk for reading difficulties. Additionally, teacher implementation of reading interventions plays a key role in the efficacy of reading interventions. Previous research suggests the influence of intervention implementation fidelity on student language and literacy outcomes is more significant for lower-performing students and students with disabilities, such as dyslexia. However, recent syntheses have suggested that less than half of reading intervention studies report treatment fidelity data. This meta-analysis examined fidelity reporting within reading intervention studies for students with or at risk for dyslexia in Grades K-5. We aimed to record the frequency and extent of fidelity reporting, explore associations between study or intervention features and fidelity reporting, and compare mean intervention effect sizes for studies reporting fidelity and those that did not. A total of 51 studies were included. Results indicated that 75% of studies reported fidelity data. Studies reporting fidelity primarily focused on adherence and dosage data with little to no information reported for other dimensions of fidelity (i.e., quality, responsiveness, differentiation). Suggestions for improving reporting of treatment fidelity data are discussed.",

The sample comprises 11 students with severe dyslexia (2 &quot;SD&quot; below the mean pseudoword scores), and the intervention programme consists of 32 individual sessions over 8 weeks. The study applies a multiple baseline/probe design with five baseline tests that correspond to a control condition, eight tests during the intervention and five post-intervention tests. On average, the results show significant improvement in all reading and spelling outcomes. However, there were also significant effects on an irrelevant control task (the pegboard test), perhaps indicating testing effects on the dependent variables, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions from the study. Consequently, testing the intervention in randomised trials of children with severe dyslexia is recommended to draw more firm conclusions about its efficacy for this group.",

In this article, we argue that rather than defining dyslexia on the basis of an underlying condition, dyslexia is best viewed as a label for an unexpected reading disability. This view fits well with a preventive approach in which risk for reading disability is identified and addressed prior to children experiencing reading failure. A risk-resilience model is introduced that proposes that dyslexia is due to the cumulative effects of risk and resilience factors. Evidence for the multifactorial causal basis of dyslexia is reviewed and potential factors that may offset this risk are considered. The implications of a cumulative risk and resilience model for early identification and intervention is discussed.",

      "abstract": "Due in part to parent advocacy, Texas passed legislation and released guidelines to support identification and instruction for students with dyslexia, and their families. In alignment with state guidelines, since January 2020, the Houston Independent School District (HISD) implemented an additional instructional intervention using Reading by Design (RbD) and provided training to teachers and parents to improve the reading performance of students with dyslexia. A univariate analysis was conducted to explore the perception of parents and teachers, as well as the effectiveness of the Reading by Design (RbD) program on reading performance of students with dyslexia. A gain-based model was used to measure HISD students' gains in reading, calculated as the change in performance level from the beginning to the end of the 2020-2021 school year. Parents who found the process of attaining support for their child to be difficult were less likely to be involved in consultation with the school regarding their child's learning. On average, teachers reported a higher level of confidence in their ability to identify and support students with dyslexia at the elementary school level compared to middle and high school. When examined at the elementary, middle, and high school levels, RbD results showed gains in the reading performance of elementary students where teachers used a pull-out model and less so for middle and high school students where teachers used a course-based intervention model. For elementary school teachers who used RbD, 24.4 percent of their students with dyslexia had higher reading performance compared to 15.7 percent of their peers at campuses where teachers reported not using an intervention. A higher percentage of elementary school students with dyslexia who received the RbD intervention and who did not meet the Approaches Grade Level standard in pre-intervention reading (2019 STAAR) met the standard on the STAAR 2021 reading assessment.",

Two 7-year-old children, a girl and a boy, were selected from the Jyvaskyla Longitudinal Study of Dyslexia. The intervention emphasised syllables as reading units, and proceeded from reading syllables to reading words and text. Letter knowledge, reading skills (syllables, words, pseudowords, and text reading), and syllable segmentation of words were measured before, immediately after, and three months after the intervention. The results showed that the intervention mainly affected fluency at the syllable level. The girl also showed some improvements in fluency (accuracy, speed) at the word and text reading level, too, while the boy improved in reading accuracy. Children with reading difficulties appear to benefit from fluency intervention; this should initially be based on emphasising syllables as a sublexical reading unit. However, the intervention should be sufficiently long-lasting, progressing piecemeal toward bigger reading units. (Contains 7 figures and 2 tables.)",

Adequate special education teacher preparation and strong classroom organization and behavior management skills are critical for teachers of students with EBD. Little research has been conducted to determine the extent to which special education teacher preparation programs provide teachers with adequate instruction on classroom organization and behavior management techniques. Course syllabi from 26 special education teacher preparation programs were reviewed. Results indicate a highly variable emphasis on classroom organization and management between programs. Programs tended to emphasize reactive procedures. Only 27% (n = 7) of the university programs had an entire course devoted to classroom management. The remaining 73% (n = 19) of university programs had content related to behavior management dispersed within various courses. Limitations and implications for special education teacher preparation and inclusive practices are discussed. (Contains 1 table and 1 figure.)",

The problem of the research study was that it was not known how special education teachers interpret, explain, and apply their undergraduate preparation of individual behavior management strategies in K-12 classrooms. Data were collected using questionnaires, personal and a group interview across 5 weeks' time. The results found themes: (a) special education teachers believe an individual approach to working with students is essential, (b) special education teachers wanted more preparation in individual behavior management strategies, (c) special education teachers provide basic examples of individual behavior management strategies in limited detail that they learned in the classroom throughout their undergraduate, (d) special education teachers express the importance of hands-on learning experiences in undergraduate to promote competence of individual behavior management, (e) special education teachers collaborate with others to select appropriate strategies for students, (f) special education teachers use data to apply appropriate strategies in the classroom, and (g) special education teachers apply strategies learned in undergraduate preparation with additional strategies learned elsewhere to meet student needs. These teachers understand that students are unique and that it is important to use all resources available.

In an earlier study, F. H. Wood (1991) examined general educators' cost-benefit considerations in managing behavior of students with emotional or behavioral disorders. As an extension of the earlier study, the authors asked 211 special education teachers about the use, effectiveness, and labor intensity of 24 communication and 33 behavior management strategies, as well as their judgments of the likely use of these approaches by general education teachers. The results indicate that the approaches most likely to be used by special and general education teachers are also strategies the participants consider highly effective. The authors discuss the implications of their findings for preservice and in-service training in behavior management. (Contains 5 tables and 3 figures.)",

      "abstract": "Strong classroom management skills are the foundation of effective teaching and learning. However, most teachers enter the field unprepared to manage classroom behavior. Many teacher preparation programs offer preservice teachers limited coursework and fieldwork experiences focused on developing classroom management practices. The lack of training in classroom management is particularly concerning for preservice special education teachers who not only teach students with high rates of challenging behavior, but also consult, train, and support administrators and colleagues with implementation of classroom management practices. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of tiered behavior support on preservice special education teachers' rates of behavior specific praise. Tiered behavior support included goal setting, brief prompts, and visual performance feedback. A multiple baseline across participants design was used to determine if a functional relation existed between tiered behavior support and increased delivery of behavior specific praise. The participants included three preservice special education teachers in an elementary school practicum setting. The results of this study demonstrated that there is a functional relation between tiered behavior support and preservice teachers' increased use of behavior specific praise. For each participant the mean delivery rate of behavior specific praise increased following the introduction of tiered behavior support. The results of this study suggested that tiered behavior support was an effective method for developing preservice special education teachers' classroom management practices. Including tiered behavior support in teacher preparation programs could support the development of classroom management practices for preservice special education teachers.

An introductory overview identifies five basic principles of behavior management. Fourteen behavioral terms are then defined (e.g., contingency contracting, extinction, Premack principle, timeout). Guidelines for practitioners are addressed through answers to frequently asked questions including: why do instructors need a behavior management system? when does behavior management work best? when are specific behavior management techniques needed? and what are some strategies for developing behavior generalization? Behavioral strategies briefly described include modeling,  encouragement, verbal reward consequences, verbal correction consequences, contingency contracting, timeout, and self-monitoring. Attachments include a list of 99 ways to say \"very good\", a sample contingency contract, a list of reinforcers identified by secondary-aged students, and two sample teaching plans. Thirteen references are listed. (DB)",

      "abstract": "In the United States, almost half of special education teachers will leave the field within five years, citing concerns regarding student behavior as a major contributing factor. The field of applied behavior analysis has provided an effective, research-based behavioral technology for addressing challenging behavior in the classroom, but few special education teachers carry certifications in applied behavior analysis and the implementation of such research-based practices remains inconsistent. The introduction of virtual and hybrid teaching formats in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic provided additional behavior management challenges for special education teachers. This explanatory mixed methods study utilized a survey and follow-up semi-structured interviews to identify barriers and supports that influenced the ability and willingness of special education teachers to implement behavior management practices. Survey data was analyzed using one-way ANOVA and chi-square tests of association and found that years of experience, instructional delivery format, and applied behavior analysis certification were not significantly correlated with the behavior strategies used or barriers and supports experienced by special education teachers. Thematic content analysis of the qualitative data found that aspects of campus and district culture, such as relationships, competing priorities, and intrinsic motivation, were found to influence the implementation of behavior management practices. The results from this study provide areas of examination that district and campus leaders, pre-service teacher preparation programs, and behavioral specialists can utilize to increase the utilization of research-based behavior management practices, decrease challenging behavior, and increase the tenure of special education teachers in the classroom.

Individuals with special needs may exhibit problem behaviors such as aggression, harming themselves or others, and excessive hyperactivity in general. It can be said that intervening, taking precautions, and changing these behaviors in a positive way before the emergence of problem behaviors are of critical importance in facilitating these children's lives. In this sense, the examination of postgraduate theses in the field of behavior management in special education is important in terms of describing the innovations, developments, current trends, and, if any, incomplete situations in the field of behavior management. Within the scope of the research, it is aimed to examine the studies on behavior management in the field of special education in Turkey between the years 2016-2022 in terms of various variables (type of publication, publication year, publishing university, research method, subject, study group). Document analysis, one of the qualitative research methods, was preferred in this study. According to the research findings, it was concluded that most master studies were done as postgraduate publications, the most publications were made in 2019, the university that made the most publications was Eskisehir Anadolu University and the most used research method in the studies carried out was the quantitative research method. It has been revealed that it is important for other universities to design behavior management studies in special education.",

      "abstract": "Behavior management involves both the encouragement of social behavior and the reduction of inappropriate behavior. Initially, teaching efforts should be directed at identifying socially acceptable alternatives. If these efforts are unsuccessful, additional procedures that are specifically directed at the inappropriate behavior may be warranted. Essential components of all behavior management programs include behavioral definitions, measurement procedures, reinforcement procedures, reinforcement for alternative behaviors, specific program procedures, and a mechanism for monitoring and evaluating program results. When reductive procedures are necessary, the least intrusive and most positive approach should be tried prior to considering more aversive methods. The behavior contract  is highly recommended as a program component that assures student involvement and clarification of all program procedures. (This booklet provides basic information and practical ideas for implementing behavior management among special needs vocational education students. A reference list, glossary, and an annotated bibliography are included in the guide.) (KC)",

The purpose of this study was to examine the behavior management content included in preservice teacher preparation programs for general education and special education teachers. Using survey methodology, the researchers collected information from participants about the types of behavior and classroom management strategies and skills included in their preparation programs. Results suggested that preservice educators were more likely to be taught universal management strategies than more specific skills and strategies for increasing or decreasing behaviors. Significant differences were found between alternative certification general education teacher certification programs and college/university special education teacher certification programs in the areas of increasing appropriate behavior and behavioral assessment.",

      "abstract": "This qualitative case study investigated the process of teaching the self-management strategies, self-determination, and self-monitoring to chronically misbehaved students from the perspective of a secondary special education teacher. The investigation used a purposeful sample to select an urban high school setting and a tenured special education teacher. The specific characteristics of the teacher participant included her teaching both ninth- and 10th-grade students with chronic behavior issues in an urban high school in southeastern Michigan. The theoretical context for the study evolved from the causal, social cognitive, and ecological (transition) theories. These theories support self-management teaching strategies and positive behavior intervention as mandated by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 2004. Findings from the study showed the need for teaching self-management skills to students with behavior problems. In addition, the findings included the most and least successful teaching strategies for teaching self-management skills and barriers the teacher faced when trying to teach self-management skills. This study implies that using a self-management system indicates that teacher-developed and -mandated behaviors are easier to control than student intrinsically managed behaviors.

The IEP provides information about the specifically designed instruction, related services, and other supports for your child (often referred to as accommodations and modifications), the educators who will provide supports, and how progress on the IEP will be collected and reviewed. The IEP team meets to create an IEP, for a yearly update, or for a new concern. Families might find it helpful to plan ahead for IEP meetings.

These guidelines are intended to result in IEPs that are streamlined, focused, and reasonably calculated to provide educational benefit. Specifically, this work is directed toward developing IEPs that provide every child with a free and appropriate public education, rather than to develop IEPs that merely show compliance with IDEA but confuses rather than addresses educational needs. The book contains detailed information emphasizing several important needs for: (1) developing a streamlined IEP process; (2) providing guidelines for IEP forms; and (3) providing a model for refocusing the IEP from a monitoring/compliance device to a document that actually represents an appropriate and individualized educational plan. Every state is required to develop a model IEP form, and the information contained in this book includes basic strategies and a basic model IEP form for achieving this task. Additional major topics include IEP planning, amendments, prereferral and referral, teams and meetings, individual evaluation, student information, Present Levels of Academic Achievement (PLAA), modifications and accommodations, measurable annual goals, IEP services, location, signatures, and reports. In the appendices, a sample IEP Form is included and a description of Public Law 108-446 is given. The strategies and discussions contained in this book will provide positive direction for the educational profession, as well as improve the quality of education for students. The books presents fifteen chapters as follows: (1) IEP-2005; (2) IEP Planning; (3) IEPs and IDEA Amendments; (4) IEP: Prereferral and Referral; (5) IEP Teams and Meetings; (6) IEP: Individual Evaluation; (7) Streamlining the IEP; (8) IEP Development; (9) IEP Student Information; (10) Present Levels of Academic Achievement(PLAA); (11) Modifications and Accommodations; (12) Measurable Annual Goals; (13) IEP Services; (14) Placement (Location); and (15) Signatures, Reports and Appendices.

We first discuss the relationship of classroom assessment and IEP goal development, followed by a discussion on how to accommodate learning objectives for classroom assessment. We further discuss how to use classroom assessment to document IEP progress. Finally, we present assessment accommodation categories by providing vignettes of students with exceptional needs who receive appropriate and adequate accommodations in inclusive classrooms. We conclude with a brief discussion on practice, policy, and research implications of accommodations for inclusive practices.",

Students who were included in general education math and language arts instruction had fewer overall IEP goals, but goals focused more on applied skill development, whereas students in noninclusion had goals addressing primarily rote and procedural skills. For students in both groups, all IEP goals were derived from kindergarten through fourth-grade standards. Likewise, for students in both groups, most IEP goals addressed core symptoms of autism (e.g., communication skills) as opposed to academic skill development, along with fewer overall goals and more curricular adaptations as students entered adolescence. Implications for practitioners are discussed. (Contains 8 tables and 5 figures.)",

      "abstract": "In this article, the author proposes that students who led their Individual Education Program (IEP) meetings were better informed about their own disabilities, rights, and accommodations, and that the act of leading the meeting resulted in improved self-advocacy and self-confidence. Also, in understanding their list of accommodations and modifications (A&amp;M), students would be able to communicate with adults and other decision-makers so that these can be improved through the skills learned in the process of leading an IEP meeting. For example, when students understand their legal rights, they can better explain them to their parents. The author concludes that the idea of centering the IEP process on the student can and should grow, and that seeing students begin to collaborate with their teachers on writing, monitoring their IEP goals, advocating for appropriate placement changes, and asking for needed accommodations across settings benefits the student. By shifting the model of IEP planning from one of adult control to one of student-centeredness, we can empower students with the skills they need to become advocates for themselves. Students can gain important social and problem-solving skills that can be used throughout their academic careers, in post-secondary settings, and in the work world.",

This book contains over 100 topics that deal with real issues and concerns regarding the regular classroom and the special education process. These concerns range from requirements for referring a child for an individual evaluation, school discipline, classroom-based assessment, IEP meetings, inclusion and mainstreaming, and various legal requirements relating to IDEA, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the No Child Left Behind act. It stresses the importance that every child with a disability must have goals &quot;to enable the child to be involved in and make progress in the general education curriculum.&quot; Other issues interspersed within this text include classroom needs, the planning of individualized education programs, and participation in all aspects of the general curriculum. In order to achieve these goals, support for the regular classroom teacher must be provided so that children with disabilities can be involved in, and make progress in, the curriculum and participate in nonacademic activities.

      "title": "Teachers' Perceptions of the Efficacy of Standards-Based IEP Goals",
      "abstract": "Although standards-based IEP goals have been mandated in many states for almost a decade, their effectiveness is unknown. Standards-based IEP goals were first created to meet the requirements of No Child Left Behind and Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act, which increased accountability for all students as well as those with disabilities, while providing targets for state standardized test scores and ensuring access to, and progress in, the general education curriculum for students with disabilities. Factors, such as teacher training, collaboration, and accountability may influence teachers' perceptions of aligning IEP goals to grade level expectations. Using a survey, this study examined teachers' perceptions of the efficacy of standards-based IEP goals. One hundred prekindergarten and kindergarten female teachers responded to the survey. Calculations from a linear regression indicated that a relationship existed between the usage of standards-based goals and curriculum-based measures. Results also indicated that teachers may choose to ignore standards-based IEP goals at times to focus on individual students' needs. Overall, teachers reported that they wrote or gave input into the development of IEPs. However, not all teachers recognized the benefits of students with disabilities in general education classrooms, despite indicating that accommodations and modifications were generally defined. Future research suggestions include investigating perceptions regarding standards-based IEP goals in terms of type of disability of the student. Additionally, a review of personnel preparation programs could provide additional information about the training that teachers receive regarding standards-based IEP goals.

      "abstract": "This policy statement clarifies the role of the Individualized Education Program (IEP) team in selecting individual accommodations, modifications in administration, and alternate assessments for state and district-wide assessments. It states that neither the state education agency (SEA) nor the local education agency (LEA) can limit the authority of the IEP team to select individual accommodations and modifications in administration needed for participation in state and district-wide assessments. However, the SEA or LEA must ensure that their assessments are valid, reliable, and consistent with professional and technical standards. Thus, it is possible for an IEP team to select accommodations or modifications that produce scores that are deemed invalid under state or local  polices for purposes of reporting, accountability, or determining student benefits such as promotion or high school diplomas. The policy statement goes on to state that although the SEA and LEA cannot constrain the IEP team's decision about accommodations and modifications, the SEA and LEA can provide guidelines and training to assist IEP teams in making informed decisions. The statement discusses considerations that must be examined as SEAs and LEAs endeavor to preserve the authority of IEP teams while at the same time maximizing student participation. (CR)",

      "title": "An Investigation into the Involvement of California Central Valley High School Students with Disabilities in the IEP Process",
      "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the involvement of California Central Valley high school students with disabilities in the Individual Education Plan (IEP) process. Specifically, this study investigated the involvement of students with disabilities in the development of the IEP and IEP meetings. In addition, this study explored the activities and processes special education teachers used to involve students in the IEP process. A chronological mixed methods design was utilized for this study as both a quantitative approach through descriptive survey research and qualitative methods were used. This chronological approach was implemented as the researcher collected data via an electronic survey from 99 California Central Valley high school special education teachers who educate students with learning disabilities and moderate intellectual disabilities, 16 years of age or older, and then used survey results to inform a qualitative portion of the study, in-depth interviews of 10 special education teachers. The quantitative study portion focused on frequency of involvement of students with disabilities in the IEP process, including both involvement in IEP meetings (invited to attend, attendance, participation, and student led) and development of the IEP (transition plans, present levels, goals, services provided, educational setting, accommodations, and IEP meeting preparation and scheduling). Results revealed that although students were invited to attend their IEP meetings, with a majority of students attending, student participation was much lower than actual attendance, and student led IEP meetings were scarce, and in many instances never occurred. Results also indicated that although the majority of students were involved in the development of transition plans and accommodations at varying degrees, more than half of respondents indicated that students were involved less than 50% of the time, if at all, in development of present levels, goals, services, educational settings, and preparation and scheduling of IEP meetings. Four major themes emerged from the qualitative analysis relative to the activities and/or processes special education teachers used to involve their students with disabilities in the IEP process: Student Interview/Discussion/Conference, Career Assessment, Student Portfolios, and Role Play.

The IEP is a roadmap to enhance in-school and postschool outcomes for students with a disability. We reviewed IEPs (n = 89) for secondary students with MLD enrolled in 15 rural independent school districts in the southeast part of the United States. Results suggested secondary students with MLD have needs in (a) calculation; (b) fractions, decimals, and percentages; (c) functional mathematics; (d) reading; and (e) social and behavioral skills based on annual goals written in their IEPs. Yet 70% of the IEPs reviewed included only instruction in the general education setting, without specialized services. IEPs included a variety of accommodations, but few goals facilitated access to grade-level content or special education services to support specialized instruction to meet goals.

Next, suggestions for preparing for the IEP meeting are offered. These include reading their existing IEP; following an 11-step procedure to help identify individual strengths, needs, goals, and objectives; inviting the appropriate people; and practicing what to say. Suggestions are also offered for actual participation in the meeting and for following up after the meeting. A list of note-taking, test-taking, and additional accommodations  during the IEP meeting is provided. The audiocasette presents students with disabilities, including learning disability, emotional disturbance, and traumatic brain injury, explaining their role in IEP development and how it enhanced their self-esteem and improved their relationships with teachers.

Three domains of testing accommodations were examined; (a) accommodations recommended through the IEP process, (b) accommodations recommended by the teacher, and (c) accommodations provided in the testing sessions, to explore factors that potentially influence the implementation of recommended testing accommodations. The Assessment Accommodations Checklist (AAC) was used as a means of translating the IEP process from diverse school districts into a common framework. A three-category system developed by CTB/McGraw-Hill was used to characterize potential threats to validity posed by each of the recommended and provided accommodations. Accommodations that were frequently recommended and used (i.e., provide extra testing time, read directions to students, provide distraction free space, etc.) are discussed with regard to the CTB/McGraw-Hill categories, and aspects of future research are outlined.

      "abstract": "Efforts to promote self-determination have been a principal focus of transition planning in support of students with disabilities for nearly two decades. However, research and recommendations related to self-determination have been primarily centered on promoting student participation in the IEP process and ensuring broader preparation for effective transition planning in the later school years. Beyond fruitful participation in the IEP process itself, students with disabilities who are included in general education settings require self-advocacy and communication skills in order to ensure the effective and consistent delivery of their designated IEP accommodations, which are designed to facilitate their successful acquisition of academic content and overall learning. This article describes a model for teachers to employ when training students with disabilities to self-advocate on a day-to-day basis, thereby supporting students&apos; ability to obtain needed accommodations while also engaging school contexts with a positive sense of self-directedness, agency, and efficacy.

      "abstract": "Introduction: Children with optic nerve hypoplasia (ONH) frequently have co-occurring developmental disorders, and children with both visual impairments and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have complex educational needs. Research Question: Do the individualized education programs (IEPs) of children with visual impairment and ASD comport with national educational guidelines? Methods: Participants were 13 children enrolled in a larger longitudinal study of ONH. Children were assessed for ASD, verbal intellectual functioning, and level of visual impairment. An IEP coding manual was developed by the authors and used to compare the IEP goals, services, and accommodations to national guidelines for the education of children with visual impairment and children with ASD. Results: Key findings indicated that needs in the domains of academics, assistive technology, and orientation and mobility were addressed, but other crucial areas of development such as social skills, social-emotional and behavioral needs, and skills for independent living were commonly overlooked. Discussion: It is recommended that IEP teams pay greater attention to the complex range of needs of children with visual impairments and that national guidelines for the education of children with visual impairment and ASD be incorporated into federal special education law. Implications for Practitioners: National guidelines for the educational needs of children with visual impairments and with ASD provide important guidance for IEP teams when developing goals, services, and supports, and efforts should be made to ensure educators and parents are aware of them. Children who have both visual impairments and ASD have complex educational needs that are often not fully addressed in IEPs. In particular, social-emotional, behavioral, and developmental needs may be overlooked by IEP teams, and consistent inclusion of school psychologists or other mental health professionals on IEP teams may lead to greater attention to these areas of need.",

      "abstract": "Due to China's unique rural-urban dual system, education differs significantly between rural and urban schools. However, research related to the rural-urban disparity in inclusive education is limited. Moreover, general education teachers' instructional strategies, in particular, remain unclear and could be studied further. To bridge this gap, a qualitative method was adopted to interview 16 general education teachers in rural and urban inclusive classrooms in China, and the differences in inclusive instructional strategies, teaching design, and support for and barriers to general education teachers' inclusive instruction were explored. The findings showed that shorter assignments and different expectations were the most frequently utilised strategies in inclusive classrooms; teachers' teaching designs were significantly geared towards general education instead of students' individualised needs, and the barriers to inclusive instruction were far greater than the support obtained. Moreover, general education teachers in urban areas adopted more teaching strategies, had fewer barriers to inclusive instruction while receiving more support than rural teachers. Implications for future research and practices in the field of general education teachers' instructional strategies in inclusive education were discussed.",

      "abstract": "Background: Indonesia's implementation of inclusive education continues to help support students' development of academic abilities and social skills. However, it also poses challenges for several parties involved in the administration of inclusive education in rural areas: in particular, teachers from general education backgrounds. Purpose: This study aimed to investigate teachers' teaching strategies in inclusive education in a sample of public primary schools in rural Indonesia, in order to better understand the strategies used and the teachers' perspectives on inclusive education. Methods: Participants were 40 classroom teachers from 10 public primary schools in rural Indonesia. The participants taught students from grades 2 to 6 (student ages 8 to 12) and had at least one student with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) in their class. Observations were conducted to determine the extent to which teachers used differentiation, collaborative learning and inclusive classroom management strategies. After the observations, short interviews were conducted with the teachers in order to explore their perceptions of inclusive education. Data were analysed qualitatively. Findings: Analysis of observation data showed that only a small number of teachers used teaching strategies that were considered effective inclusive strategies, such as differentiation and collaborative learning. The interview findings indicated that most of the teachers did not feel confident in using inclusive strategies, due to factors including limited knowledge of strategies, and class size. Conclusions: This small-scale study suggests that the implementation of inclusive education remains at an early stage and is challenging in some parts of Indonesia. It highlights that sustaining and advancing teacher education is crucial: through professional development, teachers can be enabled to increase their competence and knowledge of inclusive education strategies, ultimately benefiting all students in the classroom.",

      "abstract": "Introductory physics is a gateway course that is required for many science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) majors. In introductory physics courses, women and racially minoritized students often have lower grades and higher attrition than white men. Inclusive teaching is widely recommended to ensure that all students have the opportunity to fully participate and succeed in the learning process. Thus, inclusive teaching practices may help increase the diversity of people in STEM majors and careers. However, these recommended inclusive teaching practices are not widely used in introductory physics courses. This study seeks to better understand the extent to which introductory college-level physics instructors use inclusive teaching strategies as well as their reasons for the use or nonuse of such practices. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 11 male instructors from a variety of higher education institutions in Michigan who taught introductory calculus-based physics courses in Spring 2022. The participants were asked to describe their use of and beliefs about 23 specific inclusive teaching strategies. Results show that few of these instructors are aware of the full range of inclusive teaching strategies. Most instructors are aware of inclusive teaching strategies that are related to active learning and frequently articulate valid reasons for implementing these strategies. However, when implementing inclusive teaching strategies, they often do not do so in ways that are known to be most effective. Instructors are less aware of and less willing to use inclusive teaching practices that require acknowledging differences in students' identities. Their reasoning is that physics is an objective science that has nothing to do with race, gender, or other aspects of identity. Overall, this preliminary study suggests that significant work is needed to help introductory physics instructors understand, value, and implement the full range of inclusive teaching strategies.",

Despite the inclusive education policy, disability remains a major course of exclusion in learning institutions. The paper discusses the impact of school strategies in overcoming physical barriers that hinder the implementation of inclusive education. The actual sample constituted 151 respondents. The data were collected using questionnaires to identify views from 100 teachers teaching learners with disabilities, interviews from 11 learners with disabilities to discuss personal experiences on physical barriers and 5 focus groups discussions with non-disabled learners learning in the same classroom with learners with disabilities. The study was guided by Social Model of Disability and adopted a mixed method research design. Quantitative data were analyzed using inferential statistics. The ANOVA and t-test were done to test the study hypotheses. Qualitative data were organized by developing codes, then categorized into themes and presented in a narrative form. Linear regression was carried out to check the linear relationships between the variables. The study established the school strategies were not anchored in overcoming physical barriers that hindered the implementation of inclusive education, with various challenges affecting the strategies. For this reason, learners with disabilities have to adjust to get the needed education or drop out of school. Therefore, the study concluded that ineffective school strategies contributed to lack of overcoming physical barriers and this negatively impacted the implementation of inclusive education in schools. School transformation founded on clear inclusive education vision and philosophy, policies and inclusive strategies are necessary to overcome physical barriers hindering the implementation of inclusive education.",

      "abstract": "The problem addressed by this study was the minimal community college baseline data regarding faculty use and attitudes of universal design principles, known as inclusive teaching strategies, and the relationship to faculty years of teaching experience. The purpose of this quantitative correlational study was to assess faculty use and attitudes of inclusive teaching strategies at one Midwest community college using the Inclusive Teaching Strategies Inventory to determine if there was a relationship between faculty use and attitudes and years of teaching experience to develop appropriate faculty trainings. This study was administered as a single point in time, non-experimental, cross-sectional electronic survey. The research questions addressed to what extent, if any, there was a relationship between faculty use and attitudes of inclusive teaching strategies subscales of accommodations, accessible course materials, course modifications, inclusive lecture strategies, inclusive classroom, and inclusive assessment and faculty years of teaching experience at a community college. Pearson's Product-Moment Correlation was applied to measure the strength and direction of association that existed between the independent and dependent variables. Spearman's Rho correlational analysis was applied to all subscales. Spearman's Rho found an inverse relationship between the inclusive classroom subscale for both use (-0.288 [p &lt; 0.01]) and attitudes (-0.229 [p &lt; 0.01]) and years of teaching experience indicating as faculty years of teaching experience increase, use and attitudes of inclusive classroom strategies decrease. It was recommended that faculty trainings regarding inclusive classroom strategies be developed, and targeted implementation occur for faculty with increased years of teaching experience. Further research is needed to address faculty years of teaching experience and the potential relationship to Inclusive Teaching Strategies Inventory subscales.

      "abstract": "This study was focused on investigating inclusive learning environments in accelerated classroom formats. Three 8-week sections of an undergraduate course at Regis University were examined. Results from observations and surveys were analyzed to determine the effectiveness and consistency of 13 inclusive strategies derived from Wlodkowski and Ginsberg's (1995) Culturally Responsive Teaching framework. Prescribed strategies from the University and individual instructor style were additional strategies for consideration in creating inclusive learning environments. Major findings revealed inclusive learning environments were created through various combinations of strategy use; however, findings also revealed certain strategies were not being used. These results indicated ineffective use of certain inclusive strategies which the researcher used to offer suggestions for improving consistency in meeting the University's learning outcome of knowledge of diverse cultures, perspectives, and belief systems. Recommendations for future professional development were proposed.    [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

This paper will describe, briefly, the background, policy and teacher education initiatives towards inclusive education, as well as some relevant aspects of the study, especially in respect of the perceived teacher efficacy, instructional adaptations and collaborative roles in inclusive classrooms. In discussing future directions, it is proposed that the thoughtful teaching paradigm is applied in developing more thoughtful strategies in inclusive education. Specific examples will be presented to illustrate how some of the proposed teaching strategies could be more creative, reflective, responsible and reciprocal in order to cater to the diverse needs of students in Brunei Darussalam.",

This study explored the experiences of inclusive educators in the classrooms, intending to gain perspective on how teachers describe their strategies employed to manage classrooms and foster students' learning and social development in an inclusive environment. Many researchers have investigated classroom management strategies, but few studies explored strategies to support education, classroom management, and social development in inclusive settings. Social learning theorists argue that individuals recognize their perspectives and behaviors through social modeling. Social learning theory guided this qualitative descriptive study of 25 teachers who were invited to participate in the interview; however, only 11 were selected. With the employment of the qualitative descriptive approach, the results indicated that drawing on external resources to manage the classroom and incorporating classroom management expectations for learning strategies help teachers run the classrooms. The study also found that supporting social development strategies for students and developing a relationship to foster interpersonal connection with learning-disabled students in an inclusive classroom helped inclusive teachers to run their classrooms. Future research must be completed to provide leaders with additional knowledge on this topic. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

      "abstract": "This qualitative study examined the inclusive strategies in language teaching that teachers (ties) employed to cater to the different linguistic backgrounds (tongues) of the primary learners in the Philippines. It also explored the effects of these inclusive strategies on the pupils' learning. Five teachers teaching in a classroom with linguistically diverse students and 16 linguistically diverse pupils from kindergarten to Grade 3 participated in the study. Findings from interviews, classroom observation, visual learning materials, and learning logs revealed that teachers utilized diversifying instructional materials, diversifying communication mediums, and diversifying activities strategies to cater to all the pupils' needs despite their language differences, making inclusive education accessible. However, although these strategies were inclusive, they evoked maximized learning and minimized learning in the pupils. Because diversity is a constant in multicultural settings like the Philippines, the findings suggest that teachers must improve time management while using inclusive strategies to offset the minimized learning effect, i.e. the lack of time. Implications and recommendations are discussed.",

First, a discussion of the usefulness of differentiated instruction in increasing the likelihood of success for children with disabilities is provided. Next, qualitative data supported the implementation of the differentiated instruction process to help the teacher realize how she could positively impact students' learning using Tomlinson's (2000) categories of content, product, process, and learning environments. Finally, recommendations are provided for how to engage teachers to implement differentiated instruction as a data-based iterative process of using evidence-based practices to meet the needs of all children in an inclusion classroom.

Recently, a growing emphasis on differentiated instruction may have further increased teachers' tendency to look at learning styles as an instructionally relevant variable when individualizing instruction in increasingly heterogeneous classrooms. We discuss the overlapping concepts of individualized instruction and differentiated instruction, briefly review the evidence base for learning styles, and argue that instruction should indeed be individualized and differentiated. We conclude that there is insufficient evidence, however, to support learning styles as an instructionally useful concept when planning and delivering appropriately individualized and differentiated instruction.

One method used is differentiated instruction. Differentiated instruction is based upon the idea that all students learn in different ways and that each learner needs to receive materials and methods of instruction that fit his/her individual learning style and the appropriate curriculum (Mastropieri &amp; Scruggs, 2007, p. 126). Differentiated instruction works for all students, but is especially useful for students in special populations. The seven &quot;building blocks&quot; to help educators differentiate instruction are: (1) Know the learner; (3) Quality curriculum; (4) Positive classroom environment (appropriate class size, arrangement, population); (5) Flexible teaching and learning time; (6) Multiple methods of instruction; and (7) Multiple methods of assessment.",

      "abstract": "Despite a rural Georgia school district's effort to increase the academic performance of all students, the achievement gap persists between general education and special education students. The purpose of the study was to explore what factors hindered coteachers from consistently applying differentiated instruction in elementary inclusion classrooms. The conceptual framework for the study emanated from Vygotsky's social development theory as it related to teachers learning from each other through professional collaboration. The research questions explored coteachers' perceptions about differentiated instruction for students with disabilities. Using a case study methodology and purposeful sampling of 6 general education and 6 special education teachers, who met the criteria and agreed to participate, qualitative data were gathered through surveys, semistructured teacher interviews, and lesson plan documentation. Open-ended surveys, transcribed interviews, and lesson plans were coded and analyzed through open and axial coding to generate themes. The major themes identified included teacher perceptions of differentiated instruction, implementing differentiated instructional practices, and supports needed for successful differentiated instructional practices. The findings indicated a need for a systematic approach to professional development on differentiated instructional strategies to improve educational growth for students with disabilities. The recommended professional development may contribute to positive social change by increasing coteachers' impact on the learning environment for special needs students. This increased impact may lead to higher graduation rates and more self-sufficiency among students. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

In an inclusion class with students of mixed abilities, differentiated instruction allows the teacher to meet the needs of every learner by providing students with multiple options for learning allowing each student to make his or her own meaning from what is being taught, and enabling each student to individually express what he or she has learned. The mathematics and inclusion teachers restructured the class in a way that facilitated differentiated instruction and resulted in increased student learning. Here, the the authors describe the restructuring process and offer suggestions for other teachers who wish to try this approach. (Contains 2 figures.)",

      "abstract": "Differentiated instruction is a proactive teaching model and philosophy with demonstrated potential to cater for diverse learners and create inclusive classrooms. There is little research, however, into the implementation of this approach in the senior secondary classroom. Teachers' implementation of differentiated instruction has been shown to be linked to teacher attitudes and self-efficacy in other settings. This study investigated the impact of teachers' self-efficacy and attitudes towards the implementation of differentiated instruction in the senior secondary context across two Australian states with a total of five participating teachers. The A (Affective) B (Behaviour) C (Cognitive) model was employed to define teacher attitudes from interviews concerning differentiated instruction. Findings indicated that teacher knowledge was a major factor influencing differentiation, in addition to attitude and self-efficacy. The discourse analysis demonstrated that teachers held a greater knowledge of differentiation strategies than the concepts that underpin the differentiated instruction framework. Additionally, time constraints and feelings of failure in implementing differentiation strategies impacted teacher attitudes. Teacher knowledge, attitude and self-efficacy were interrelated and impacted on teachers' implementation of differentiated instruction in the senior secondary classroom. Implications for professional development to address student needs through differentiated instruction in the inclusive senior secondary classroom teacher are discussed.",

      "abstract": "The presented challenge in education revolves around the effective utilization of differentiated and individualized instruction by special education teachers, aiming to address the unique needs of students with learning disabilities. This study's purpose was to identify ways to use these instructional methods to develop methods that create better educational experiences for the teacher and student. The research methodology was qualitative with a narrative design. The population was high school and middle school special education teachers in New Jersey. Purposeful and snowball sampling was used. The instrumentation used to collect information was interview questions. Data analysis procedures were collecting previous literature and information from interviews to develop common and different themes presented in the responses given. The predictive benefits of the study were potential strategies that could be used to alleviate problems and challenges presented when implementing differentiated and individualized instruction. The beneficiary of this study would be special education teachers. The findings were that differentiated and individualized instruction is beneficial in promoting inclusivity, increasing desired behaviors, developing self-awareness, cultivating relationships, increasing engagement, and supporting self-advocacy. Some detriments experienced while differentiating and individualizing instruction are time, collaboration, overaccommodation, resistance, standardized testing, and fairness.

      "abstract": "A cornerstone of inclusive education is teacher's readiness to respond adequately to different educational needs of students in their diverse classroom. Differentiated instruction, referring to the process by which teachers carefully monitor students' needs and progress, and adapt their instruction according to these differences, is a means to meet the needs of students of different levels. High-quality differentiated instruction is a complex process for teachers which needs careful preparation. This makes teachers' intentions relating to differentiated instruction particularly relevant. In this article we compare two theoretical models to explain teachers' intentions to differentiate: the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and Self-determination theory (SDT). Secondary school teachers (n = 180) responded to a questionnaire in which we measured their intentions and predictor variables relating to both of the theoretical models. Linear regression showed that both the TPB as well as the SDT model significantly predicted teachers' intentions (p &lt; 0.01), but that the TPB model showed a better fit with the data (48 versus 32% explained variance). We conclude that in addition to the factors included in the TPB, autonomy might be a relevant factor in explaining teachers' intentions.",

It also seeks to understand what conditions within school systems support or hinder attempts by special educators to implement these strategies. Participants in the study included four first-year special educators, one teacher and one tutor who are middle school educators, and one teacher and one tutor who work in elementary schools. The study included personal observations in each participant's classroom and semi-structured interviews. Three questions guided the analysis of interview data: How did the first-year teachers come to know their students individual needs? What specific teaching strategies did they use to provide for  different abilities levels? and What kind of support (materials and supervisory feedback) did they receive for these differentiated strategies? Special first-year teachers share with their regular educator counterparts pedagogical concerns, lack of administrative support, and the need for both materials and appropriate planning times. Unique to special educators is the pedagogical demand for differentiated instruction according to the individualized plan provided for each student, which continues to drive the pedagogical strategies of these first-year educators. Thus the university training for differentiation continues to shape their actual classroom instruction. (MAH)",

The researcher examined special education and general education teachers' use of differentiated instruction curriculum through classroom observations. The participants consisted of special education and general education teachers from two suburban elementary schools in a southern school district. After reviewing the data from the quantitative and qualitative questions from the survey, teacher interviews, observation, and open-ended questions, these implications emphasize that teachers need to receive continued support from the district. This study found teachers used differentiated instruction, but only at a basic level. Some general education teachers used the same differentiated instruction strategies or methods for the entire class. Based on the teachers perceptions in this study differentiated instruction tools provided a good foundation for teacher to use with students in learning to read.

There always may be a contradiction in wanting to promote change in instructional practices while, at the same time, relying on a teacher education concept that is based on modeling by established teachers. The problem is especially obvious in the area of differentiated instruction because the practice is embedded in the contextual factors and dynamics of a classroom (Lawrence-Brown, 2004). As teacher educators, we rely on students to learn how to differentiate instruction through observation, mentoring, trial-and-error, and even differentiation that is inconsistently practiced in the schools where we place them (McBride, 2004). It is an important contradiction to resolve, as there is ample evidence to suggest that differentiating instruction allows us to better address the needs of our students, especially in the context of universal standards (Anderson, 2007; McTighe &amp; Brown, 2005; Subban, 2006). Given the demographic trends in our public schools, our increasingly explicit focus on addressing student diversity, the strict legal mandates to properly serve students considered to have special needs, the ongoing drive toward inclusion, and efforts to hold teachers responsible for the test scores of individual children, the lesson, &quot;mostly, differentiating means ignoring,&quot; is troubling and runs counter to everything that we want our future teachers to learn. While, as teacher educators, we may speak to our students about the need to differentiate, this is not followed up in actual instruction, which is not differentiated in the ways that we propose. Thus, the concern is what we can do to ensure a focus on differentiated instruction in practice without relying entirely on actual classroom settings. This article provides a review of the literature on differentiated instruction and describes interventions that have been implemented in the context of the author's two intensive one-year master's programs that lead to teacher certification in elementary and secondary education.

      "abstract": "Although the necessary role of differentiation in special education is well established in the literature, little is known about its social and peer interaction implications from the student perspective. The present qualitative study aims at offering detailed observational analyses of the meanings that 7- to 9-year-old students give to differentiated instruction in its initial phases in authentic classroom activities. The results were yielded from an ethno-methodological conversation analysis of the video-recordings of authentic classroom situations in a part-time Finnish special education setting (N = 12 lessons). The results revealed that whilst differentiation as a pedagogical solution serves to meet children's individual learning needs, students used knowledge of the differentiated treatment as a means by which to construct an understanding of their abilities in relation to those of their classmates or to seek self-enhancement over their peers.

      "abstract": "Despite well-intentioned professional development programs designed to improve teachers&apos; effectiveness in the use of instructional practices that have the potential to enhance student achievement (e.g., differentiated instruction), a discrepancy exists between the promise these practices hold and their actual use by teachers in classrooms. To address this discrepancy, this study explored how teachers actually learned the beliefs and mental models that accompanied their development of proficiency in the use of differentiated instruction. The conceptual framework for the study was the TRIO model of adult learning. The particular area of focus was the relationship between (a) key experiences, (b) changes in teachers&apos; beliefs, and (c) proficiency in the use of differentiated instruction. The study used an interpretive qualitative design. Semi-structured interviews, intended to identify teacher beliefs and their relationship to key experiences, were conducted with six key participants who were highly skilled in using differentiated instruction to meet the needs of individual students in mixed-ability classrooms in a suburban elementary school. Data were also obtained from classroom observations of these participants prior to the interviews to ascertain that they were, in fact, differentiating their instruction. The interview data were analyzed to identify (a) teachers&apos; key learning experiences, (b) related changes in teachers&apos; beliefs about teaching and learning, and (c) the development of teachers&apos; proficiency in applying differentiated instruction. Findings indicated that the key experiences that shifted teachers&apos; mental models in relation to learning and teaching were (a) collaborating with peers, (b) co-teaching, and (c) working within a coaching model of professional development. Findings also demonstrated that practice in implementing a social curriculum, specifically Responsive Classroom, was a key experience that helped teachers understand their students as learners. In turn, this knowledge about their students enhanced their ability to use differentiated instruction. Finally, all teachers reported that having a personal or professional understanding of students with special learning needs shifted their thinking about what students could or could not achieve. The discussion includes implications for practices that hold promise for increasing teachers&apos; proficiency in meeting the learning needs of individual students in mixed-ability classrooms.

The first 50-minute videotape, &quot;A Focus on Inclusion,&quot; discusses how to deliver appropriate curriculum to children with special needs in inclusive classrooms, evaluate student products, implement instructional processes, and use on-going assessments. Educational strategies such as multiple intelligences, principles of learning, cooperative learning, brain compatible learning, curriculum scaffolding, and environmental organization are highlighted. The second 50-minute videotape, &quot;A Focus on the Gifted,&quot; targets customized practices that are most effective in classrooms that  seek to challenge gifted/high achieving students. The viewer's guide begins with a discussion of differentiated instruction. It provides an overview of the issues and challenges in today's schools, emphasizing the rationale for and value of this approach to instruction. Chapter 2 contains reproducibles/handouts. These are designed to be of particular value in training as they facilitate an understanding of the concept presented. Chapter 3 provides specific reference materials that are associated with the text found in the guide and chapter 4 offers additional resources related to the topic of differentiated instruction.

      "title": "Improving Mathematics Achievement of Exceptional Learners through Differentiated and Peer-Mediated Instruction",
      "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to implement differentiated and peer-mediated instruction to determine if these instructional interventions were successful in preparing students with disabilities for state standardized tests. In addition, this study identified how exceptional needs learners responded to techniques utilized during differentiated and peer-mediated instruction. The objective of this study was to determine if the interventions produced significant differences in mathematics achievement of exceptional learners and to provide a context in which the selected interventions invoked student behavioral response. The study focused on the following questions: (1) What is the difference in achievement for students receiving differentiated instruction to those receiving peer-mediated instruction?; (2) How does the implementation of differentiated instruction yield differences in achievement across exceptionalities, including learning disabled, mildly intellectually disabled, other health impairment, and emotional and behavioral disorder?; (3) In what ways will the implementation of peer-mediated instruction yield differences in achievement across exceptionalities, including learning disabled, mildly intellectually disabled, other health impairment, and emotional and behavioral disorder?; (4) How do exceptional learners respond to differentiated instruction?; (5) What are the differences in response to differentiated instruction for exceptional learners classified as learning disabled, mildly intellectually disabled, other health impairment, and emotional and behavioral disorder?; (6) How do exceptional learners respond to peer-mediated instruction?; and (7) What are the differences in response to peer-mediated instruction for exceptional learners classified as learning disabled, mildly intellectually disabled, other health impairment, and emotional and behavioral disorder? To solve the problem multiple methodologies were utilized. Mixed-method designs employ qualitative and quantitative research. Qualitative research seeks to explore phenomena in a naturalistic setting through interpretive data analysis. Quantitative research seeks to explain phenomena through empirical data analysis. Appended are: (A) Field Log; (B) Student Response Tally Sheets; (C) Assignment Completion Tally Sheets; and (D) Student Interview Guide. (Contains 7 tables.)

      "abstract": "This applied dissertation was designed to provide a targeted training for novice teachers with the use of Behavior Skills Training model. Novice teachers struggle with behavior management in the classroom setting. While there is a growing need for strategic in-class intervention for students with problem behaviors, there is not a system training for novice and veteran teachers that prepares educators to address the increase of problem behaviors among students.The researcher developed the targeted training that is grounded in the science of applied behavior analysis and incorporates its principles and strategies. With the use of Behavior Skills Training, the researcher trained teacher participants to apply the newly learned behavior management strategies in the classroom setting. The Behavior Skills Training model included instructions, modeling, rehearsal, and feedback. Relying on Classroom Data Collection Tool, the researcher collected data that accounted for the participants' use of general praise, error correction, opportunities to respond, and student disruptive behaviors.Analysis of the collected data revealed mixed results with no clear indication of a hypothesized increase in application of the target skills across participants. Two out of three participants increased their ability to apply the applied behavior analysis strategies to improve the classroom environment and reduce student problem behaviors. Based on the visual analysis of data of all participants across the target behaviors, the participants' performance was not consistent between the intervention and follow-up phases. Future research studies should address the study limitations and incorporate teaching of functional behavior assessment, direct assessment of principles of applied behavior analysis, and adult learning principles as prerequisite skills.&amp;#xa0; [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

The CWS included three sets of rules, posted cues to indicate the rules students are expected to be following at that time, and transition procedures for altering activities and rules. Class-wide data analysis showed large, immediate, and sustained increases in OT behavior when the CWS was applied, with OT behavior returning to baseline levels when typical classroom management (TCM) procedures were reinstated. Each student's average phase data also showed increases in OT behavior when the CWS was applied and re-applied, and showed reductions when the CWS was withdrawn.

Teacher behaviors that are aligned with applied behavior analysis and that have been shown to improve students' literacy performance include creating task analyses; modeling, prompting, and fading; providing frequent active response opportunities; giving performance feedback; using reinforcement contingencies; providing systematic review; and programming for generalization. These behaviors are discussed using examples from research.",

To date, reviews of social skills training groups have mainly focussed on children, rather than adolescents and adults. This review aimed to critically evaluate studies published in the past 20\u00a0years that had used group-based social skills training to improve the social skills of adults and/or adolescents with ASD. Thirteen studies were identified, and group-based social skills training was generally effective at improving social skills, with some studies observing transfer effects to improvements in wider psychological wellbeing. Future research should focus on comparing different social skills training protocols in real-world clinical settings.",

This study examined the effectiveness of a &quot;Dog Training Intervention&quot; on adaptive skills, autism severity, and anxiety using a controlled crossover design. Seventy-three participants diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (M[subscript age] = 4:10 \u00b1 1:0) were divided into two groups that received the dog training intervention during half of the school year in addition to standard-of-care interventions. The dog training intervention, in which the children were taught how to interact with and train dogs, was given twice weekly for 4 months within autism spectrum disorder-specific special education school. Those receiving the dog training intervention first showed significantly increased adaptive social and communication skills compared to the controls, and the gains were maintained after the dog training intervention. Belonging to the first dog training intervention group, higher pre-intervention adaptive skills, higher baseline cognitive ability, and less severe autism severity predicted better adaptive social and communication skills. The controls improved in adaptive skills only during their receipt of dog training intervention after crossover. The positive impact on social communication skills suggests that dog training may serve as an effective model for establishing social interaction. Dog training intervention appears to be an effective adjunct treatment to interventions provided in special education schools for children with autism spectrum disorder.",

      "abstract": "This applied dissertation was designed to evaluate the effects of social skills training programs as a method to improve social skills in children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. The study sought to advance the social skills training options for children with autism spectrum disorder by comparing various evidence-based social skills training programs in hope to provide meaningful, significant, and sustainable social-emotional changes that are explicitly taught and later generalized across individuals, settings, and environments. The researcher specifically evaluated the effects of social skills group training and computer-based social skills training among the three study participants with autism spectrum disorder. The researcher developed appropriate group training and computer-based interventions. Daily sessions provided participants with the skill-based training on nonverbal behavior, social interaction, and social engagement. Participants completed various group and computer-based training sessions and demonstrated the use of appropriate social skills. An analysis of the data revealed that there was an improvement in social skills during both treatment conditions. However, the participants' social skills increased at a higher rate when the social skills program included technology-based components. The research findings suggest that technology-based strategies appear to be the most effective tool to teach communication and social skills to young children with autism spectrum disorder because it produced a high rate of responding and skill acquisition across all participants.

      "abstract": "Students with autism spectrum disorder often require social supports to function well in a mainstream class setting. Researchers have demonstrated the effects of social skills training for students with autism, but their work has focused primarily on topographically defined outcomes, such as increasing the frequency of social behaviours. More research is needed to address the functional impact of social skills training on social experiences, such as improvements in the quality of life for students with autism. This study examined the effects of a behavioural skills training form of social skills intervention on the social interactions of students with autism in an inclusive school setting. The intervention increased participants' social behaviour. However, its mixed results in the quality of peer responses may be a more meaningful indicator of its effect on the quality of social lives of the participants. The authors discuss the implications of these findings for current practice and future research.",

      "abstract": "One of the most prevailing characteristics of children with autism is their deficit in social communication skills. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a peer-mediated social skills training (SST) program combined with video feedback, positive reinforcement and token system in increasing social communication skills in young children with high-functioning autism. Four boys with high-functioning autism, ages 6-7 years, participated in the study. The social skills training, lasting 12 weeks, targeted six communication skills, selected after parent interviews and behavioral observation during a pre-training assessment period. One SST session was conducted each week, each session lasted 90 min and had six structured activities. The training effectiveness was evaluated through direct observation of a structured interaction period, using an observational coding system. Improvement was observed in three out of four children, although individual differences among children were seen for changes in two global scales as well as subscales. These results suggest that the social skills training was effective in improving social communication skills for some children with high-functioning autism. Clinical and research implications and future directions for social skills training as well as this study's limitations are discussed.",

      "abstract": "This study was a qualitative examination of special education teachers' perceptions of social skills training for students with autism. The problem is that without social skills training, individuals with autism are not learning the social skills necessary for independence. Those impacted by social vulnerabilities are individuals with autism, their families, and society. The purpose of this study was to explore how special education teachers describe social skills training. Bandura's self-efficacy theory provided a framework for understanding teachers' descriptions. This study used a qualitative descriptive approach to explore the teachers' descriptions. Interviews and a focus group provided responses to open-ended questions that allowed for in-depth answers to personal teaching experiences. A six-step thematic analysis method was used to identify and examine themes generated in the data collection process. Interview data was transcribed, compiled, and reviewed. Central concepts were identified using a manual coding system based on the theoretical lens of this study. The research questions acknowledged how special education teachers perceive social skills training for students with autism and the improvement needs for social skills training. The collected data confirmed that teachers want consistency, relevance, and generalization opportunities to teach social skills more effectively. The findings in this study align with Bandura's self-efficacy theory. Teachers' descriptions were based on the sources of self-efficacy that include mastery level, ideals about SST, and the ability to self-generate SST curriculum. There is implication for further study to understand what teachers believe will improve social training for students with autism and how self-efficacy impacts program effectiveness. It is recommended that further study be conducted on teachers' influence on social skills training for students with autism.

      "abstract": "Autism is a neuro-developmental disorder typically appears prior to the age of three years, and seriously limits the normal development of children. However, there is a wide variety of effective intervention programs and strategies designed to help children with autism. Hence, this research aimed to see the effect of social skills training on interpersonal interaction of children with autism. Using pre-post equivalent experimental and control group design, data were collected from a sample of eight children using Autism Social Skills Profile Rating Scale before and after the implementation of social skills training. Data were analyzed through frequency, percentage, mean, standard deviation, and independent samples t-test. The pre-intervention assessment revealed that participants of the experimental and the control groups did not significantly differ but both groups scored below half on the total scale point and almost one-third of the maximum score on social reciprocity and social participation sub-scales. The result of the intervention also indicated that children in both groups demonstrated positive changes in their overall social skills including the sub-scales. However, it was found out that the experimental group has greater mean scores as compared to the control group on total scale, social participation and social reciprocity subscales. But the increment on detrimental social behaviors subscale in the experimental group was with a decreasing rate. Based on this finding, it can be concluded that social skills training intervention improves social skills of children with autism. Therefore, it is recommended that further intensive and comprehensive intervention is very critical to more improve the social skills of children with autism.",

      "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common neurodevelopmental condition characterized by impairments in communication, social interactions, as well as motor functioning. Additionally, individuals with ASD are at a greater risk for health concerns due in part to a more sedentary lifestyle. Therefore, it may be advantageous to introduce more physical activity or sport-based training into autism therapeutic programs. Here, we introduce and evaluate a 6-week, 12 session golf-training program that integrates the teaching of autism-relevant social and communicative skills into each lesson. The results showed that all 46 participants (M = 11.46, SD = 6.21) improved on at least one outcome measure, and statistically significant increases in all measures (communication skills, social skills, motor skills, and regulatory skills) were detected from pre to post. These preliminary findings highlight the utility of an autism-targeted golf training program for all ages; future studies should seek to replicate this strategy in other settings and using other sports or recreational activities.",

      "abstract": "Systematic reviews show some evidence for the efficacy of group-based social skills group training in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder, but more rigorous research is needed to endorse generalizability. In addition, little is known about the perspectives of autistic individuals participating in social skills group training. Using a qualitative approach, the objective of this study was to examine experiences and opinions about social skills group training of children and adolescents with higher functioning autism spectrum disorder and their parents following participation in a manualized social skills group training (&quot;KONTAKT&quot;). Within an ongoing randomized controlled clinical trial (NCT01854346) and based on outcome data from the Social Responsiveness Scale, six high responders and five low-to-non-responders to social skills group training and one parent of each child (N = 22) were deep interviewed. Interestingly, both high responders and low-to-non-responders (and their parents) reported improvements in social communication and related skills (e.g. awareness of own difficulties, self-confidence, independence in everyday life) and overall treatment satisfaction, although more positive intervention experiences were expressed by responders. These findings highlight the added value of collecting verbal data in addition to quantitative data in a comprehensive evaluation of social skills group training.",

Parents of six groups of adolescents (n = 46, 61% male, mean age 14.6) completed questionnaires immediately before and after the 12-week group. Parents and adolescents were surveyed regarding their experience with the group. Significant pre- to post-treatment gains were found on measures of both social competence and problem behaviors associated with AS/HFA. Effect sizes ranged from 0.34 to 0.72. Adolescents reported more perceived skill improvements than did parents. Parent-reported improvement suggests that social skills learned in group sessions generalize to settings outside the treatment group. Larger, controlled studies of social skills training groups would be valuable.",

In this mixed-methods study, pre- and post-intervention surveys, interviews, and functional measures were used to gather information on the program's feasibility, user acceptability, practicality, and preliminary efficacy. Results indicate that Assistive Soft Skills and Employment Training graduates showed significant improvements in work-related social skills knowledge, social functioning, and social/empathy self-efficacy. Participants and group facilitators also reported high satisfaction with program activities, training modalities, frequency, and duration of the intervention. Results support expanded use of group-based, work-related, social skills interventions for young adults with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder. Moreover, these findings, though preliminary, suggest that manualized, empirically based programs like Assistive Soft Skills and Employment Training promote improved social functioning, self-confidence, engagement, and adherence to training, as well as broader impacts, including improved sense of belonging and greater employability in this traditionally underserved population.",

      "abstract": "Transition into higher education (HE) has received increased interest in recent years, since it represents a challenging period for students. The aim of this study was to further understand the associations between self-efficacy, academic achievements, and regulation in first-year university students during their transition into HE. The convenience sample consisted of 374 first-year university students (230 females, 61.5%), aged from 18 to 33 (M\u00a0=\u00a019.86, SD\u00a0=\u00a01.51) and recruited from an Italian university. Self-efficacy was assessed using the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire; regulation strategies were assessed with the Inventory of Learning Patterns of Students; and a self-reported grade point average was taken as an indicator of each student's academic performance. Result shows that students' self-efficacy was positively associated with self-regulation and negatively associated with a lack of regulation. Students with higher self-efficacy and self-regulation strategies had better academic performance. Female students performed better in academic activities and adopted more external regulation strategies. The findings represent an opportunity for university institutions to consider the interventions they provide to first-year students in order to facilitate the successful transition from secondary school; they also provide researchers with further knowledge about the effect of self-efficacy, and regulation strategies on students' adjustment to HE.",

Moreover, students who reported high levels of constructivist learning environment perceptions also reported using more metacognitive self-regulation strategies. Mediation analysis indicated that metacognitive self-regulation strategies mediated the relationship between constructivist learning environment perceptions and critical thinking dispositions.

      "abstract": "Although self-regulation is an important feature related to students' study success as reflected in higher grades and less academic course delay, little is known about the role of self-regulation in blended learning environments in higher education. For this review, we analysed 21 studies in which self-regulation strategies were taught in the context of blended learning. Based on an analysis of literature, we identified four types of strategies: cognitive, metacognitive, motivational and management. Results show that most studies focused on metacognitive strategies, followed by cognitive strategies, whereas little to no attention is paid to motivation and management strategies. To facilitate self-regulation strategies non-human student tool interactional methods were most commonly used, followed by a mix of human student-teacher and non-human student content and student environment methods. Results further show that the extent to which students actively apply self-regulation strategies also depends heavily on teachers' actions within the blended learning environment. Measurement of self-regulation strategies is mainly done with questionnaires such as the Motivation and Self-regulation of Learning Questionnaire.",

Some environmental conditions, such as organization of materials and clear expectations, support the development and use of self-regulation learning (SRL) strategies in reading. Teachers who use explicit instruction and modeling of SRL strategies have more students who can use self-regulation to read for longer periods and respond to higher order thinking questions. However, there are highly self-regulated students (even though fewer numbers) in low self-regulation classrooms, suggesting that individual differences in SRL strategies exist among gifted students and perhaps some gifted students as early as fifth grade have already attained the individual ability to use self-regulated learning SRL strategies to read and learn. The combination of domain-specific strategy instruction in reading combined with the use of SRL strategies to support knowledge acquisition seems to help more students in the higher self-regulation classroom achieve and maintain focus during reading instruction.

With this in mind, the present study attempts to investigate the self-regulated learning strategies of English-as-a-foreign-language (EFL) students from a local university in Vietnam. The study aims to identify EFL students' self-regulation level, correlation between their two cognition knowledge and cognition regulation, and the correlation between their self-regulation level and GPA. Data is collected via a survey questionnaire encompassing two core components of cognition knowledge and cognition regulation. The results show a high level of the involved students' self-regulation, a correlation between their cognition knowledge and cognition regulation, but a gap between their self-regulation level and GPA. On the obtained findings, pedagogical implications are addressed, and further research is suggested.",

Students who face difficulties with self-regulation may experience substantial deficits in their academic achievement. However, research has pointed to a number of effective instructional strategies and interventions which may be particularly beneficial for improving students' acquisition of academic skills. One such strategy is self-regulation interventions, which are typically comprised of cognitive learning strategies, mnemonic strategies, and/or behavioral management strategies. The aim of this meta-analysis was to synthesize and analyze extant research on the impact of self-regulation (as defined in this study) interventions on primary and secondary students' math, reading, and writing outcomes. Peer-reviewed publications from the last 50 years were identified through a systematic search, which resulted in a total of 46 studies included in the meta-analysis. This systematic review yielded an overall positive effect of self-regulation interventions on academic outcomes, suggesting that self-regulation interventions can lead to improved reading, writing, and math scores for children and adolescents. The increased and sustained development and implementation of self-regulation interventions in school settings may be particularly beneficial for targeting deficits in self-regulation and promoting academic achievement.",

      "abstract": "The present study aimed to examine the specific relations between five motivational regulation strategies (i.e., interest enhancement, environmental control, self-consequating, performance self-talk, mastery self-talk), academic self-concept, and three cognitive learning strategies (i.e., organization, elaboration, rehearsal) of 415 university students. A total of n = 238 students were in the first year of their university program, while n = 178 students were in the mid-term of their university program. Results of correlation analysis revealed that all five motivational regulation strategies were positively related to the three cognitive learning strategies. In contrast, regression analysis showed that organization was only significantly linked to interest enhancement, self-consequating, and performance self-talk, while elaboration was only significantly linked to self-consequating, and rehearsal was only significantly linked to interest enhancement and performance self-talk. Academic self-concept proved to interact with interest enhancement in predicting elaboration. Furthermore, the measurement separability of the three constructs (i.e., motivational regulation strategies, academic self-concept, cognitive learning strategies) and measurement invariance across sample for the five motivational regulation strategies were also supported.",

Harris's (2003) self-regulated strategy development model, this study examined whether self-regulation procedures would increase the effectiveness of a writing strategies training designed to improve 4th graders' (N = 113) composition skills. Students who were taught composition strategies in conjunction with self-regulation procedures were compared with (a) students who were taught the same strategies but received no instruction in self-regulation and (b) students who received didactic lessons in composition. Both at posttest and at maintenance (5 weeks after the instruction), strategy plus self-regulation students wrote more complete and qualitatively better stories than students in the 2 comparison conditions. They also displayed superior performance at a transfer task requiring students to recall essential parts of an orally presented story.",

In this study, the two MSLQ subscales specifically designed to assess self-regulation--Metacognitive Self-Regulation subscale and Effort Regulation subscale--were examined. Results indicated that the structure of the two scales is not supported by the original data reported by Pintrich, Smith, Garcia, and McKeachie in 1991 or new data. Statistical and theoretical analyses supported two modified scales, the General Strategies for Learning scale and the Clarification Strategies for Learning scale, that assess academic self-regulation from the original MSLQ items. The statistical and theoretical analyses, results, and modified scales are discussed. (Contains 9 tables and 1 figure.)",

First, the relationship between various facets of emotion regulation strategies and self-efficacy beliefs was investigated. Second, emotion regulation strategies were scrutinized in relation to academic achievement. Using a sample of middle school adolescents (N = 478; 181 female), from a collectivist society, the results of correlation analysis revealed positive and negative relationships between different facets of emotion regulation strategies and self-efficacy beliefs. For instance, reappraisal (a positive emotion regulation strategy) was positively correlated with academic self-efficacy, a critical facet for learning and academic achievement (r = 0.32, p &lt; 0.01). Similarly, there were positive and negative correlations between emotion regulation strategies and academic achievement. Implications for both adolescents and schools are discussed.",

Results indicated that there was no statistically significant effect for the email treatments but a statistically significant relationship was observed between self-efficacy and achievement. The findings are discussed with an emphasis on the reciprocal relations between self-efficacy and self-regulation. (Contains 5 tables.)",

Building on cognitive, clinical, social, and educational conceptions of self-regulation, the current paper integrated affective (e.g., reappraisal, suppression), behavioral (e.g., environmental, planning), and cognitive (e.g., cognitive focusing, metacognition) forms of regulation with self-regulated learning strategies (deep and surface processing, organization, engagement) to predict achievement. Overall, self-regulation was employed more frequently in favorite courses and by college students. Path models examined the associations of affective, behavioral, and cognitive regulation with learning strategies and achievement. These analyses suggested that affective, behavioral, and cognitive regulation were related to learning strategies, but the links to achievement were less robust. Moreover, there were significant indirect paths from behavioral and cognitive regulation to achievement through learning strategies, although some of these indirect paths were counter to expectations.",

One, results indicate that the instrument evaluated in the study provides a reliable and valid method for assessing six motivational regulation strategies in a college population. Two, analyses revealed differences in the extent that students reported using the regulation of motivation strategies, while also showing them to be related to other aspects of self-regulated learning in a theoretically consistent way. Last, findings from a series of multiple regressions indicate that students&apos; engagement in motivational regulation is a function of their existing motivational beliefs and attitudes.

The participants included two males and two females, each one having between five and 20 years of teaching experience. Participants were interviewed three times, using symbolic interactionism as the philosophical overview and the Seidman technique of interviewing. Three questions guided this study: (1) How do rural Kansas high school agriculture teachers make meaning of self-regulation and the processes needed to facilitate self-regulation?; (2) In what ways do teachers self-regulate for their own professional growth purposes?; and (3) What strategies do teachers use to foster self-regulation in their students? Findings suggest while participants described utilizing strategies associated with self-regulated learning, they most closely associated self-regulation with effort and motivation. Key implications for practice include incorporating a self-regulated learning focus into preservice education, specifically during microteaching and student teaching experiences. Recommendations for future research include exploring the effectiveness of self-regulated learning instructional strategies that hold promise for teaching teachers and students to utilize self-regulation cognitive strategies.",

In this study, correlational survey method was used. The 949 8th grade secondary school students determined by stratified sampling method formed the sample of the study. In this study, &quot;Motivational Strategies for Learning Questionnaire&quot; and &quot;Attitude Scale for English Course&quot; were used as data collection tools.

As a result of the study, it was found that there is a moderate, positive and significant relationship between students' TEOG English achievement and self-regulation, cognitive strategy, self-efficacy, intrinsic value and attitudes towards English course; and there is a low, positive and significant relationship between students' TEOG English achievement and students' test anxiety. It was found that students' intrinsic goal orientation, self-efficacy perceptions and attitudes towards English course predict 43.9% of the variance in students' self-regulation strategies, while test-anxiety does not significantly predict self-regulation strategies. It was found that the students' self-regulation strategies (self-regulation, cognitive strategies), motivational beliefs (self-efficacy, test anxiety, intrinsic value) and attitudes towards English course can predict 55.2% of the variance of their English academic achievement. In this respect, it may be suggested that teachers and students to be trained on motivational strategies through various training activities and seminars.",

      "abstract": "Purpose: Self-regulation is defined as strategic, metacognitive behavior, motivation and cognition aimed at a goal (Zimmmerman and Schunk, 2011). Co-regulation, arguably more aligned with norms in communal cultures, is the process of learners sharing &quot;a common problem-solving plane&quot; through which self-regulatory strategies are learned (Hadwin and Oshaige, 2011, p.247). This paper aims to investigate the impact of co-regulation on self-regulation and math achievement for culturally diverse students. Design/methodology/approach: This empirical study used structural equation modeling framework to estimate the effects of co-regulation on self-regulation and math achievement, as measured by the statewide-standardized test. Surveys measuring students' use of co-regulatory and self-regulatory strategies and standardized math test scores were collected from 625 seventh- and eighth-grade students in a suburban district outside a southeastern urban center in the 2011-2012 academic year. Findings: Results indicated that co-regulation is positively and significantly related to self-regulation strategy use among students in the sample. Self-regulation and co-regulation were positively related to math achievement. Data suggest the modeled relationship of co-regulation, self-regulation and achievement may vary by ethnic group. Originality/value: A large body of literature documents the impact of self-regulation on student achievement, although there is less focus on students of color. This work expands that body of literature by examining co-regulation as a predictor of self-regulation and its mediated effects on student achievement for students of color.",

The meta-analysis included 34 studies with 1058 participants aged 5-33\u00a0years. Results indicated an overall significant medium effect of physical activity interventions on improving executive function in people with neurodevelopmental disorders under the random-effect model (Hedges' g = 0.56, p &lt; 0.001). Significant moderators of the effects of physical activity intervention on executive function included age, intervention length and session time, executive function subdomains, and intervention dose (total minutes in the intervention). This meta-analysis provides support for the effectiveness of physical activity interventions on executive function among people with neurodevelopmental disorders. Future studies and limitations are discussed.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents the findings of a study conducted with preschool teachers trialling an intervention in which executive function activities are embedded in teachers' daily practices and imaginary play is used to build meaningful problem situations that children solve using executive functions. The participants were 227 preschool children (53% male, M age = 55.5 months, SD = 4.2) in 10 preschool groups from Brisbane, Australia. The intervention consisted of educators and children creating and developing an imaginary situation (playworld) over an extended period (e.g. one school term). Executive function was assessed pre- and post-intervention. A repeated measures ANOVA demonstrated significant differences between Time 1 and Time 2 on all executive function measures. The study found that teachers can develop children's executive functions when executive function activities are embedded in teachers' daily practices, and when imaginary play is used to build meaningful problem situations that children solve using executive functions.",

At baseline, adolescents (n = 102) aged 12 to 19\u00a0years were administered a performance-based measure of executive function and self-report measure of broad-based risky behavior engagement. Additionally, a teacher report for each participant delineating executive function was obtained. In line with our hypothesis, hierarchical multiple regression analyses indicated that adolescents exhibiting poor observer-reported executive function (i.e., teacher report) were more likely to engage in a greater frequency of risky behaviors. Conversely, there was no relationship between the performance-based measure of adolescent executive function and risky behaviors. These findings highlight the importance of obtaining teacher input when operationalizing youth vulnerability, particularly as this relates to understanding executive function deficits. Clinical implications for in-school intervention programs are discussed.",

This study examined the role of competitive versus cooperative exergame play on short-term changes in executive function skills, following a 10-week exergame training intervention. Fifty-four low-income overweight and obese African American adolescents were randomly assigned to a competitive exergame condition, a cooperative exergame condition, or a no-play control group. Youths in the competitive exergame condition improved in executive function skills more than did those in the cooperative exergame condition and the no-play control group. Weight loss during the intervention was also significantly positively correlated with improved executive function skills.

      "abstract": "Background: This study was aimed at investigating the impact of a single exercise intervention on executive function in young adults with Down syndrome (DS). Methods: Considering the relations among executive function, physical and mental health and early onset of Alzheimer's disease in this population, we tested three components of executive function (e.g. choice-response time, attention shifting and inhibition) that have been shown to be impaired in previous studies. Ten persons with DS were assigned to an exercise group, who walked on a treadmill for 20?min at moderate intensity and ten additional persons with DS were assigned to an attentional control group, who watched a video. Measures of executive function were tested pre and post interventions. Results: These results showed non-significant improvements in choice-response time (P?=?0.32) and attention shifting (P =?0.13) but a statistically significant improvement in inhibition (P?=?0.03) after the exercise intervention. Conclusions: Given the improved inhibition ability, exercise may be an effective intervention, even in a signal session. However, only a few studies have focused on this topic. Based on theoretical models linking exercise to executive function, we proposed that exercise may increase arousal status or enhance neural transmission. Hence, future work is needed to examine the exact mechanism in the relationship between exercise and executive function for individuals with DS.",

This article describes a theoretical paradigm for understanding, assessing, and teaching that emphasizes the central importance of six executive function processes: goal setting, cognitive flexibility/shifting, organizing, prioritizing, accessing working memory, and self-monitoring (Meltzer, 2007, 2010, 2013a). For each of these core processes, there is an emphasis on the effects of executive function on learning as well as some of the challenges experienced by students with learning disabilities. There is also a focus on the interactions among executive function processes, self-awareness, effort, and persistence as well as the major principles of intervention and treatment.

The goal of this study was to assess the executive function in children with intellectual disability (ID) through the use of the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) teacher version. An additional goal was to examine the differences in executive function in relation to child's sex, level and aetiology of ID. Method: The sample consisted of 90 children with ID attending two special education schools in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. There were 42 children with mild ID and 48 children with moderate ID. Of those, 54 were boys and 36 were girls. Children were classified into three etiological categories: 30 children with Down syndrome, 30 children with other genetic cause or organic brain injury and 30 children with unknown aetiology of ID. Special education teachers, who knew the children for at least 6 months filled the BRIEF. Results: Children with ID had a significant deficit in executive function as measured by the BRIEF. There were no statistically significant differences in executive function in relation to the child's sex. Level of ID had a significant effect on executive function. In relation to the aetiology of ID, the only significant difference was on the Shift scale of the BRIEF. Conclusions: Knowing what executive function is most impaired in children with ID will help professionals design better intervention strategies. More attention needs to be given to the assessment of executive function and its subsequent intervention in the school settings.",

      "abstract": "Students with learning disabilities have been reported to have difficulty in a number of different executive function processes that affect their academic performance (Singer &amp; Bashir, 1999). Executive function difficulties for students with learning disabilities have been implicated as the reason why these students struggle with complex academic tasks such as reading, writing, and note-taking (Denckla, 2007). This mixed-methods study explored the extent to which a strategic note-taking intervention encouraged more efficient employment of executive function in middle school students with learning disabilities. This paper draws on interviews, students' notes, and pre- and post-intervention assessments to present case studies of three student participants. Results indicate that the strategic note-taking intervention served as a scaffold, opening up new pathways for struggling students to access executive functions and flexibly deploy cognitive strategies. Importantly, &quot;how&quot; each student did so and &quot;what&quot; each student learned about her/himself as a learner in the process were dependent on the specific challenges presented by her/his learning disability. These cases shed light on the potential for cognitive scaffolding to help students actively improve their own executive functioning in complex tasks such as note-taking",

      "abstract": "This systematic literature review sought to reconcile the evidence of efficacy for interventions and approaches to enhancing self-regulation and/or executive function in preschool settings. Following PRISMA methodology, a comprehensive search of 20\u00a0years of intervention research identified 85 studies that met inclusion criteria. Interventions were categorised by intervention approach and coded for their characteristics (e.g. sample size, dose, duration, interventionist, intervention activities), outcomes (e.g. significance, size of effects) and study quality (i.e. risk of bias). Reconciliation of intervention results indicated (1) within intervention approaches, some approaches had more consistent and robust evidence of efficacy (e.g. mindfulness, mediated play, physical activity) and (2) across intervention approaches, characteristics that had greater (or exclusive) presence amongst the higher efficacy interventions (e.g. cognitive challenge, movement, as well as interventionist, fidelity and dose considerations). Implications for future intervention (re)design, and for theorising about mechanisms of self-regulation and executive function change, are discussed.",

The current study examines two promising avenues of intervention aimed to reduce stress and prevent psychopathology in this population: a coping skills group and a cognitive training program. Participants: 62 undergraduate students from two universities were recruited from 2013 to 2015. Methods: Students were randomized to a 6-week coping skills group or cognitive training program and completed measures of stress, coping, executive function, and symptoms of anxiety, depression and Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) at pre- and post-intervention. Results: Participants in both conditions reported significant decreases in social stress, executive function difficulties, and anxiety symptoms post-intervention. Students in the cognitive program improved significantly more on measures of behavior regulation and ADHD symptoms compared to the coping group at post-intervention. Conclusions: Brief stress management interventions targeting coping and executive function may benefit college students at risk for psychopathology.",

The girls, ages 11 to 14, were at risk for low self-esteem, sedentary lifestyle, and poor health outcomes. Executive function stems from interdependent cognitive control processes that influence goal setting and information processing, which complement higher order thinking required for acquiring scientific process skills. A 20-week informal triathlon training program served as the intervention for the treatment girls (n = 29). The comparison group of girls (n = 30) was randomly drawn from a matched sample of students of a similar demographic. Mean comparisons, ANCOVA, and Roy-Bargmann stepdown analysis were used to measure outcomes. The intervention contributed to significant improvement in several executive functions and science achievement. These results suggest that an afterschool program with a physical fitness component may improve the executive functions involved in science learning.",

This study describes how school-based occupational therapists address executive functioning in practice and determined if this differs from traditional areas. Fourteen occupational therapists from four districts in Michigan completed the 36-item online survey consisting of closed and open-ended questions. A majority of these participants agreed that executive functioning impacts school function and occupational therapists should address it in school; yet, only 33% provided intervention using this lens and 77% indicated this as the area they feel least prepared to address in school-based practice. Executive function practice significantly differed from handwriting (p &lt; 0.05), sensory (p &lt; 0.01), and fine motor competency (p &lt; 0.01); fine motor and sensory evaluation (p &lt; 0.05); and handwriting intervention (p &lt; 0.05). Participants described their role with executive functioning as collaborative, supplemental to enhance participation, and applicable to functional organization tasks. Although some occupational therapists are embracing an occupation-based process explicitly considering executive functioning, a majority need continued education, role clarity, and advocacy to more intentionally align their team's services with emerging best practice.",

Recently, the hypothesis has been advanced that executive functioning may benefit from changes in neurobiological processes induced by physical activity. The present research explored this hypothesis by systematically identifying and reviewing intervention studies targeting the relationship between physical activity and executive functions, distinguishing between different types of intervention and of executive function. The review found considerable evidence for beneficial effects of physical activity on executive functions, with performance benefitting more consistently in inhibition tasks than in dual task coordination, shifting tasks, or combined tasks. Possible physiological explanations are discussed. Open questions for application and future research concern the sustainability of effects, the design of physical activity interventions, and the role of individual differences. Possible interventions applicable to educational settings are discussed. (Contains 5 tables.)",

      "abstract": "Children with autism spectrum disorders often exhibit co-occurring sensory processing problems and receive interventions that target self-regulation. In current practice, sensory interventions apply different theoretic constructs, focus on different goals, use a variety of sensory modalities, and involve markedly disparate procedures. Previous reviews examined the effects of sensory interventions without acknowledging these inconsistencies. This systematic review examined the research evidence (2000-2012) of two forms of sensory interventions, sensory integration therapy and sensory-based intervention, for children with autism spectrum disorders and concurrent sensory processing problems. A total of 19 studies were reviewed: 5 examined the effects of sensory integration therapy and 14 sensory-based intervention. The studies defined sensory integration therapies as clinic-based interventions that use sensory-rich, child-directed activities to improve a child&apos;s adaptive responses to sensory experiences. Two randomized controlled trials found positive effects for sensory integration therapy on child performance using Goal Attainment Scaling (effect sizes ranging from 0.72 to 1.62); other studies (Levels III-IV) found positive effects on reducing behaviors linked to sensory problems. Sensory-based interventions are characterized as classroom-based interventions that use single-sensory strategies, for example, weighted vests or therapy balls, to influence a child&apos;s state of arousal. Few positive effects were found in sensory-based intervention studies. Studies of sensory-based interventions suggest that they may not be effective; however, they did not follow recommended protocols or target sensory processing problems. Although small randomized controlled trials resulted in positive effects for sensory integration therapies, additional rigorous trials using manualized protocols for sensory integration therapy are needed to evaluate effects for children with autism spectrum disorders and sensory processing problems.",

Investigators measured target behaviors individualized for each participant in sensory processing skills, psychosocial skills, and classroom engagement. Data were analyzed visually and statistically. Sensory diets may have changed participants' sensory processing, psychosocial skills, and classroom engagement behaviors. However, target behaviors for each participant responded to sensory diets differently. Control intervention of non-therapeutic fine-motor visual activities did not change these behaviors. Positive and individualized changes in sensory processing, psychosocial, and classroom engagement behaviors were noted for each of the five children when sensory diets were administered in brief sessions throughout a school day. Changes did not occur in response to control intervention sessions indicating the sensory aspects of the intervention may have had influence.

      "abstract": "A student's ability to participate effectively within a classroom environment is dependent on a multitude of factors. However, two such factors, sensory processing and self-regulation skills, are often not well understood by teachers due to limited training and education on these topics. Current research indicates that teachers report managing classroom behaviors as a significant challenge. Sensory processing abilities and self-regulation skills can play a large role in behavior thus warranting support for increased teacher training in these areas to optimize the learning environment for everyone involved. Occupational therapy practitioners working in the school system are distinctly qualified to provide support in this manner by training teachers within Tier 1 of the Response to Intervention process due to their role as a related service in the school and their consideration of client factors, performance skills, and the environment on participation. Providing support at the Tier 1 level allows for the implementation of school-wide programming covering a range of topics that both teachers and students can benefit from. Educating teachers on the use of sensorimotor strategies, how to provide social-emotional learning opportunities and considerations for environmental modifications allows school-based occupational therapy practitioners to equip teachers to approach academic instruction in a more holistic manner.",

      "abstract": "Sensory processing has been linked with difficulties in school participation in children. Teacher perceptions of student sensory processing behaviors at school can impact outcomes, but have been underexplored. This study aimed to describe and explore factors influencing teacher rating of sensory processing difficulties in primary school aged children in their first 5 years of schooling (Kindergarten to Year 4). Binary logistic regression explored teacher rated sensory processing in 194 mainstream school students (mean age 7.79 years; male = 114, 58.76%) to determine factors influencing teacher rating of sensory processing difficulties. Male sex, age of student, class size and teacher qualifications were significant influencing factors. Findings have important implications for identifying and supporting children with these difficulties. These include the importance of screening for these difficulties, understanding underlying sensory patterns in designing classroom supports and being aware of possible biases in teacher ratings. There are multidisciplinary implications for those working in schools as well as related policies and practices.",

      "abstract": "For infants and toddlers demonstrating feeding problems, it is critical to find the basis for the problems to create more pleasurable mealtimes for the child, his or her family members, and caregivers. Feeding difficulties can affect general health, developmental gains, and emotional well-being. Understanding the cause of feeding problems and developing appropriate interventions can promote feeding-related developmental skills, facilitate overall development, and enhance family relationships. There is a growing knowledge base regarding sensory processing problems and their possible effects on daily routines and activities. A sensory processing problem refers to an individual's inability to process incoming stimuli from his or her environment in a productive way. This article describes assessment methods, strategies, and outcomes related to feeding problems with underlying sensory processing issues in infants and toddlers. The authors provide an overview of general feeding strategies and specific sensory modulation strategies that can be used to assist infants and toddlers with sensory-based feeding difficulties.

Nonetheless, recent research has found that early childhood educators are frequently implementing sensory strategies in the classroom despite this lack of evidence. This article provides educators with an evidence-informed roadmap for choosing interventions to address sensory needs in children with ASD, and steps for implementing and evaluating the impact of these interventions in their classrooms. Each child with ASD is unique, and therefore it is imperative to work with an occupational therapist to determine the child's sensory processing needs and tailor interventions to meet these individualized needs.",

      "abstract": "This study examines the impact of a general education classroom-based sensory program for students exhibiting sensory processing differences in the school environment. Students were divided by age and degree of sensory needs between control and experimental groups, with teachers of students in the experimental group implementing the recommended sensory program (BrainWorks) with all students in the classroom. In spite of the top-down nature of the training for teachers, which generated a skeptical and in some cases resistant teacher population in both groups, results demonstrated a positive impact, although the degree of magnitude differed across classrooms and age groups. Of equal significance is the difference in teacher implementation structures, which provides input for future training approaches. The degree of change in classroom performance of students in the experimental group suggests that training for teachers with students who have sensory differences is effective and that students can benefit from a classroom-based sensory program as an investment in classroom performance. The significance of this study is that it goes beyond the therapeutic environment, where sensory processing is more commonly measured, and evaluates actual classroom-level/educational setting impact, with concrete implications for effective classroom interventions. Future research in this area could expand to evaluate actual academic gains as measured by standardized academic scores, furthering the data in this study which evaluated performance on standardized sensory and behavioral measures.",

We compared oral sensory processing between children with (n = 53) and without ASD (n = 58), ages 3-11\u00a0years. We also examined the relationships between atypical oral sensory processing, food selectivity, and fruit/vegetable consumption in children with ASD. We found that more children with ASD presented with atypical sensory processing than children without ASD. Among children with ASD, those with atypical oral sensory sensitivity refused more foods and ate fewer vegetables than those with typical oral sensory sensitivity. The findings suggest that efforts to address food selectivity in children with ASD may be enhanced by including strategies that address oral sensory processing.",

Behavioral problems and sensory processing patterns were moderately to strongly correlated with emotion dysregulation. The relationship between sensory processing patterns and behavioral problems was significant with emotion dysregulation as a mediator. These findings help identify the relationship between emotion dysregulation, sensory processing patterns, and behavioral problems to facilitate the planning of intervention strategies for young children with ASD.",

Three target behaviors individualized for each child were measured, each in a group and individual classroom context.Results: Visual analysis showed a decrease in problematic behaviors for the three participants with introduction of the sensory diet. This decrease persisted after intervention withdrawal.Conclusion: Sensory diets administered in brief sessions in the school day appear to be effective in improving children's sensory processing, psychosocial, and classroom engagement behaviors and may have a continued beneficial effect. Further study is recommended to determine the relative influence of the manner of introduction of the activities as short breaks in the school day versus. the sensory activities themselves.",

      "abstract": "This study explores the educational implications of autism spectrum traits as assessed by the Deenz Autism Spectrum Profile Assessment Scale (DASPAS-42). The scale evaluates 14 dimensions: socialization, communication, sensory processing, flexibility, routine adherence, repetition, emotional sensitivity, anxiety, empathy, motor skills, attention, transitions, expression, and special interests. These traits encompass the challenges and strengths that influence students' educational experiences and outcomes. A case study of 45 students aged 10 to 18 highlights how autism spectrum traits manifest in educational settings, shaping classroom engagement, peer relationships, learning strategies, and transitions. Socialization and communication difficulties were found to impact group work and teacher-student interactions, while challenges in sensory processing and flexibility interfered with adapting to new tasks or environments. Conversely, traits like special interests and hyperfocus often contributed to deep engagement and specialized skill development when supported effectively. Findings underline the importance of understanding autism spectrum traits for designing inclusive educational practices. The study provides actionable recommendations, such as implementing differentiated instruction, developing individualized support plans, and creating sensory-friendly classroom environments. These strategies aim to foster inclusive learning spaces that not only address challenges but also leverage the unique strengths of students with autism.",

Chapters showcase how occupational therapy practitioners can effectively contribute to each tier of the multi-tiered system of supports (MTSS) framework, with an emphasis on Tiers 1 and 2. The book also provides evidence-based methods to monitor outcomes of provided interventions and discuss how and when to modify the interventions, and highlights innovative strategies to support a broad range of students, especially those who may need additional assistance but do not qualify for specialized services. While there are many reasons students might require support, this book zeroes in on sensory processing challenges and their impact on classroom participation and academic performance. By addressing these needs, occupational therapy practitioners can foster a more inclusive, engaging, and supportive learning environment for every student.",

Media format does not determine information processing and storage except when a deliberate attempt is made to model cognitive processes by manipulating the medium. Sensory channel only affects processing and learning for relatively low-level tasks, because information presented in various media formats and sensory channels is mediated by the learner's mental skills and the learning strategies used. A model can geographically show relationships among cognitive processes, mental skills, and learning strategies. Expansion of this model to include processing control through modeling and instruction in skills and strategies must include research in instruction. For  learners lacking skills and ability to select the best strategy, instruction should control learning strategies by modeling the cognitive process needed for the task. Instructional systems can also assign particular strategies for learners with some skill but without the necessary metacognitive processes required for wise strategy deployment. For high ability learners, capable of assigning the appropriate strategy independently, specific directions are unnecessary. A review of research supports this viewpoint. (LMM)",

The Sensory Processing Measure-Preschool (SPM-P) was administered as an initial test and retest to evaluate the impact of sensory processing challenges on four preschoolers both at home and at school. Following clinical reasoning, an OT faculty preceptor and OT student researchers used the SPM-P QT, a companion tool to the SPM-P, to guide the selection and implementation of sensory-based strategies by key stakeholders (parents and school staff) for 3\u00bd months. The SPM-P School retest scores revealed more improvements than SPM-P Home retest scores. However upon completion of the study, feedback by both the parents and the school staff who had selected and implemented the SPM-P Quick Tips indicated progress in social participation and in activities of daily living dependent on sensory processing and praxis (such as tooth brushing, feeding, and sleeping). This study supports intervention using the SPM-P QT by key stakeholders following the use of the SPM-P to improve occupational performance in preschool children identified as having sensory processing challenges.",

The purpose of this study was to determine the parent-reported frequency of sensory processing issues in children with DS aged 3-10 years, and the parent-reported functional impact of those sensory issues. Parents completed the short sensory profile (SSP) and a parent questionnaire (PQ). SSP results revealed a total score definite difference rate of 49%. Highest rates of probable and definite difference were in the low energy/weak, underresponsive/seeks sensation, and auditory filtering subsections of the SSP. Themes were generated from responses on the PQ regarding the functional impact of sensory differences on occupational performance in their children with DS, and related strategies currently used by parents. Findings from the study provide information to parents and health care professionals regarding sensory processing patterns in children with DS, and provide foundational data for future research.

Most of the students have retrieval difficulties on past learning. Memory difficulties directly related to sensory integration. In these circumstances the investigator made an attempt to construct Multisensory integration Approach Model based on sensory process and perceptual process. Multisensory Integration approach model contains three parts the first part is Instructional part, second part is processing part and third one is learning outcome part. Instructional part is includes seven steps. There are relating new information to prior knowledge, Focusing attention to the information, developing sensory connection, Organizing the information, Expanding sensory images, Structuring the information and Practicing recall. The above instructional strategies develop stimulation, sensation, Attention, Perception, Imagery, conceptualization and memory. The learning outcome part contains from low level sensory integration (visual-auditory) to high level sensory integration (Visual-Auditory-Tactile-Olfactory-Gustatory). The investigator regulates information processing of the students in brain through Multisensory Integration Approach Model.",

Despite the high prevalence, no research exists exploring the sensory experiences of autistic mothers, highlighting the gap in current knowledge. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 7 autistic mothers, data were analysed using thematic analysis identifying 5 major themes: antenatal experiences, sensory experiences in motherhood, the impact of sensory processing difficulties, strategies and needs, diagnosis. This research provides greater insight and understanding into the sensory experiences of autistic mothers which can influence earlier diagnosis and inform appropriate support and adaptations for autistic mothers in a variety of different sectors and highlights a possible emerging role for Occupational Therapists.",

This study examined the effects of a school-based anxiety intervention on the performance of 3 students attending school in a self-contained EBD setting. Using a single subject, multiple-baseline design across students, this study examined changes in anxiety, maladaptive behavior, and academic engagement as functions of participation in the cognitive-behavioral anxiety intervention, FRIENDS for Life. All 3 participants showed improvement across all measures. Implications for the implementation of a school-based intervention for EBD students who experience high degrees of anxiety, as well as study limitations and directions for future research, are discussed.

Within the three broad intervention areas of inappropriate behavior, academic learning problems, and interpersonal relationships, we provide a brief overview of a number of empirically validated practices. We argue that teaching students with emotional or behavioral disorders demands unique interventions that are beyond that typically available or necessary in general education. We conclude that special education \"is\" special for students with emotional or behavioral disorders and that it can be even more special with greater efforts at implementing research-based practices early, with integrity, and sustaining these interventions over the course of students' school careers.",

It offers a range of evidence-based strategies, procedures, and models appropriate for prevention and early intervention programs with young children at risk for emotional and/or behavioral disorders. Following an introductory chapter, chapter 2, \"Functional Behavioral Assessment in Early Childhood Settings: A Model for Linking Assessment Information to Intervention\" (Carol Ann Davis and Maureen A. Conroy), discusses a systematic method of assessing classroom variables linked to problem behaviors and the development of behavioral support plans. The third chapter is titled \"Engaged Supervision To Support Evidence-Based Practices for Young Children with  Challenging Behavior\" (Philip S. Strain and Gail E. Joseph) and presents supervising strategies that staff can use in early childhood classrooms to decrease challenging behaviors. The fourth chapter, \"Evidence-Based Peer Interaction Interventions for Preschool Children\" (William H. Brown and others), describes an intervention hierarchy for promoting peer-related social competence. In the fifth chapter, \"Reducing Challenging Behaviors in Young Children\" (Melissa L. Olive and others), the authors compare effects of parent- and teacher-implemented assessment-based interventions for young children with challenging behaviors. The final chapter, \"An Examination of Early Intervention/Prevention Research with Children at Risk of Emotional and Behavioral Disorders\" (Peggy P. Hester and others),  summarizes critical factors in early intervention/prevention research with children at risk for development of emotional/behavioral disorders.

The statement presents an approach for categorizing the evidence base of practices in special education. The quality indicators and the criteria for categorizing the evidence base of special education practices is intended for use by groups or individuals with advanced training and experience in educational research design and methods. The CEC's approach to categorizing the evidence base of practices in special education considers two research methods: group comparison research (e.g., randomized experiments, nonrandomized quasi-experiments, regression discontinuity designs) and single-subject research. The article next describes the standards establish criteria for five evidence-based classifications: evidence-based practices, potentially evidence-based practices, mixed effects, insufficient evidence, or negative effects. CEC's goal is that the standards will be applied to better understand the effectiveness of a range of practices for learners with disabilities. [This report was commissioned by the Council for Exceptional Children Board of Directors. A workgroup comprising seven special education researchers: Bryan Cook, Chair; Virginia Buysse; Janette Klingner; Tim Landrum; Robin McWilliam; Melody Tankersley; and Dave Test developed, vetted, and piloted the new standards for determining evidence-based practices in special education.]",

      "abstract": "Although evidence-based practices are considered critical to student success, a research-to-practice gap exists. This qualitative study examined practicing special education teachers' perceptions of their use of evidence-based practices. Special education teachers were interviewed and their classroom practices examined. Major themes emerged and findings revealed that (a) teachers believe they are using evidence-based practices, (b) teachers' awareness of research varies, and (c) teachers' personalization of research varies by awareness level. Awareness levels of credible evidence-based practices ranged from Aware, Partially Aware, and Unaware. Sources of evidence varied greatly from university coursework, research articles, co-workers' ideas, and self-generated ideas. Personalization of evidence-based practices consisted of teachers adapting and modifying practices to meet their own needs, rather than relying on fidelity of treatment measures. Implications for the special education classroom are discussed.",

Special education teachers often have little knowledge of high-quality indicators of research that identify specific evidence-based practices proven for designated populations of students with disabilities. Teacher preparation during college programs and training from districts for in-service educators has the potential to introduce evidence-based practices to special education teachers where observation, feedback, and coaching experiences can assist in the acquisition of skill and implementation into daily practice of the strategies proven effective through empirical evidence. Through the investigation of special education teachers' experiences with training on evidence-based practices, both pre-service and in-service, this study seeks to determine if teachers' report a greater degree of implementation of evidence-based practices into daily instructional practice when training has been provided and if opportunities for observation, coaching, and feedback have influenced the use of proven practices.

However, much confusion exists regarding the meaning and potential applications of evidence-based practices in special education. Evidence-based practices are traditionally supported by the findings of multiple, high-quality, experimental research studies. Rather than changing the nature of teaching or limiting teachers to following prescribed methods, prioritizing evidence-based practices will allow teachers to maximize the impact of their instructional efforts.

      "abstract": "Evidence-based practices (EBPs) are supported as generally effective for populations of learners by bodies of high-quality and experimental research and, when aligned with stakeholder values and practical needs, should be prioritized for implementation. However, evidence-based practices are not currently available for all learner types in all outcome areas. The Council for Exceptional Children's Interdivisional Research Group recommends that in the absence of relevant evidence-based practices, special educators use existing resources to identify promising practices based on the best available evidence to inform their instructional decision making. The Group fully supports the identification and application of evidence-based practices in special education. However, they also recognize that the number of EBPs identified for learners with disabilities is limited and insufficient to address all the instructional needs of special educators. In this article, they describe characteristics of credible evidence used to classify EBPs and propose that in the absence of EBPs, special educators apply the same principles to identify promising practices.

When conducting an evidence-based review, researchers apply predetermined standards to identify evidence-based practices--practices that have been shown to reliably improve an outcome for a population of learners, according to evidence from a body of rigorous, experimental studies. In this article, we describe evidence-based reviews, provide an overview of one set of evidence standards used in special education, and describe important caveats and considerations related to evidence-based reviews. We conclude with two examples of evidence-based reviews in the field of learning disabilities. Our take-home message is that evidence-based reviews are a trustworthy approach for identifying generally effective instructional practices--but no practices, not even evidence-based practices, are effective for all learners.",

With so many practices being promoted on the Internet, during in-service trainings, at professional conferences, and by their colleagues, it can be difficult to know what to try and who to trust. Evidence-based practices can be trusted to work because they have been shown to be effective by a body of research studies that meet rigorous criteria related to research design, quality, quantity, and effect size. In this article the authors provide an overview of sources of evidence-based practices and specific practices shown to be evidence-based for students with, and at-risk for, disabilities. To guide special educators in their identification and application of evidence-based practices, a 10-step framework for implementing evidence-based practices effectively is provided.

Conversely, a number of practices that have very weak empirical foundations or can be considered disproven, such as perceptual-motor training and modality instruction, continue to be used at moderate-to-high levels. In addition, compared to their North American counterparts, Australian special education teachers used a number of evidence-based practices significantly less frequently and used perceptual-motor programs more frequently.

      "title": "Influence of Context Related Factors on Saudi Special Education Teachers&apos; Understanding of Evidence, Evidence-Based, and Evidence Based Practices",
      "abstract": "The complexity of special education and the variability among students Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) require special education teachers to make a concerted effort to provide validated supports that contribute to their students' learning outcomes. Among the most important considerations for teachers is the use of teaching practices supported as effective by evidence. There is a broad consensus that the use of Evidence Based Practices (EBPs) can lead to significant improvements for students with ASD and their families. The research to practice gap is widely recognised in special education in relation to the selection and implementation of EBPs, with several studies finding that teachers used unsupported teaching practices as frequently as those supported by empirical evidence. Thus, in order to utilise EBPs, teachers must first understand what EBPs mean and how a particular practice comes to be evidence-based. Aligning with this emphasis and the increasing introduction of EBPs in special education globally, this study explored special education teachers' understanding of evidence, evidence-based, and EBPs in one centre of autism in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). In this study, a qualitative approach was used. Within this approach, a single case study design was adopted. The data were collected from six special education teachers of students with ASD using interviews. The findings revealed that teachers referred to their own individual experiences or the experiences of other teachers as evidence. In addition, they referred to their superiors' advice as being evidence-based and the perceived EBPs as technical tools handed to them by the Centre. This indicated that teachers' understanding of evidence-based, and EBPs was constructed based on the culture of the Centre. The findings of this study suggest several courses of action for future research, and policymakers and teacher education.",

      "title": "Investigating Evidence-Based Practices and Interventions Using Multifaceted Learning Theory for Students in a Special Education Self-Contained Classroom",
      "abstract": "Teachers working in a special education self-contained classroom were required to implement evidence-based practices and interventions, rarely researched in a school setting, with fidelity to meet the needs of students with intellectual disabilities. Evidence-based practices and interventions for students with intellectual disabilities were researched in clinical settings with one to three student participants and without a common evaluation tool. The purpose of this qualitative case study was to use the Tennessee Educator Acceleration Model General Educator Rubric to investigate how experienced teachers used multifaceted learning theory when implementing evidence-based practices and interventions in a diverse special education self-contained classroom to help students access Tennessee state standards. Special education teachers from eight different schools across Tennessee were interviewed and observed using the Tennessee Educator Acceleration Model General Educator Rubric, which I aligned to different learning theories. I found how special education teachers planned activities, used reinforcements, and developed their knowledge of the content and their students to accommodate and modify evidence-based practices and interventions. I observed teachers in special education self-contained classrooms apply 150 (50%) behavioral learning theory strategies, 106 (36%) cognitive learning theory strategies, and 42 (14%) constructivist learning theory strategies. These findings should continue to be explored to further develop a common evaluation tool to monitor the use of multifaceted learning theory in a special education self-contained classroom instead of requiring fidelity of evidence-based practices and interventions.&amp;#xa0; [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

We used a multiple baseline across participants design to evaluate the effects of a technology-based self-monitoring application (i.e., I-Connect) and visual supports to teach question asking skills to three males with ASD, ages 21-26. Participants selected community locations to participate in structured conversations with peers that were audio recorded. All participants demonstrated an immediate effect to increase their number of questions asked when using I-Connect to self-monitor. However, participant responding varied when visual supports were added. Maintenance also varied across participants. Findings indicated existing evidence-based practices for learners with ASD, such as self-monitoring and visual supports, can be combined in socially valid ways. Implications and suggestions for future research related to teaching conversation skills for young adults with ASD are discussed.",

Difficulty communicating with family members, forming relationships with friends, and responding appropriately to others can cause significant challenges in the home (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; DSM-IV-TR, 2000). Many children with ASDs require specialized supports to experience success in developing social interaction and communication skills. Visual supports are an inexpensive and simple intervention to help children with autism gain the social skills they will require in life. This article offers families suggestions for addressing children's social skill needs using visual supports. First, it will review the empirical research on the importance of social skills in the context of socio-emotional development. Second, it will examine the evidence base for using visual supports to enhance social skill development. Third, it will offer examples of visual supports that can be easily implemented in the home setting. (Contains 1 figure.)",

      "abstract": "Students with high-functioning autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are increasingly included in general education and are expected to access core content, including science. Development of science content knowledge, scientific literacy, and scientific thinking are areas emphasized in legislation as well as the National Science Education Standards as critical for all students, particularly as they progress to middle and high school. However, participation in science discourse is often challenging for students with ASD given their difficulties with communication. Moreover, evidence on teaching academic content, such as science, to students with disabilities is limited. In this article, the use of visual supports is described as an evidence-based practice to promote engagement in science discussions among students with high-functioning ASD.",

Participants (N = 22) performed the TGMD-2 under three different protocols (traditional protocol, picture task card protocol, and picture activity schedule protocol). Gross motor quotient scores on the TGMD-2 were measured and statistically analyzed using a within-subjects repeated-measures ANOVA. Results indicated statistically significant differences between protocols, while post hoc tests indicated that the picture task card condition produced significantly higher gross motor quotient scores than the traditional protocol and the picture activity schedule. The results suggest that more accurate gross motor quotient scores on the TGMD-2 by children with ASD can be elicited using the picture task card protocol. (Contains 1 table and 1 figure.)",

      "abstract": "Children on the autism spectrum often experience difficulty generalizing social skills across environments and contexts, which can make developing friendships challenging in early childhood. This means that, in addition to initial social skills instruction, children with autism may need specialized supports to promote the generalization of newly learned skills to natural inclusive play routines such as unstructured social centers and playdates. In this paper, we describe strategies teachers can employ to promote the generalization of newly learned social skills. Specifically, we describe how social narratives, visual supports, and environmental arrangement, prompting, and praise can be used during social centers and playdates to facilitate setting generalization. When teachers systematically support generalized social skills and behaviors, children will have more opportunities to develop meaningful friendships.",

      "title": "Learning through Seeing and Doing: Visual Supports for Children with Autism",
      "abstract": "Autism is a life-long, complex developmental disorder that causes impairment in the way individuals process information. Autism belongs to heterogeneous categories of developmental disabilities where neurological disorders lead to deficits in a child's ability to communicate, understand language, play, develop social skills, and relate to others. Children with autism face challenges such as using language, using words creatively, using imagination, and, later, thinking abstractly. These challenges significantly affect understanding and using language for communication. Because of increasing awareness of the number of cases of autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) there is a push to obtain information about how to help children with autism. Although there is no one best program or one best way of helping children with autism, the importance of using supports based on concrete and visual teaching aids is largely upheld. Visual supports can be provided in different ways in all settings: (1) school; (2) home; (3) work; and (4) community. Visual supports help bring in structure, routine, and sequence that many children with autism need to be able to carry on their daily activities. Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related-Communication-Handicapped Children (TEACCH), Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) and Social Stories developed by Carol Gray are some of the visual approaches available to help children with autism achieve their potential in every aspect of life. This article offers practical ideas for teachers and parents based on combinations of these visual approaches. Visual supports developed from simple and inexpensive everyday materials to inexpensive games are used successfully to enhance processing ability and teach social skills, play skills, academic skills, and communication skills to children with autism in elementary grades.

The TGMD-3 was administered to 14 children with ASD (4-10\u00a0years) and 21 age-matched typically developing children under two conditions: TGMD-3 traditional protocol, and TGMD-3 visual support protocol. Excellent levels of internal consistency, test-retest, interrater and intrarater reliability were achieved for the TGMD-3 visual support protocol. TGMD-3 raw scores of children with ASD were significantly lower than typically developing peers, however, significantly improved using the TGMD-3 visual support protocol. This demonstrates that the TGMD-3 visual support protocol is a valid and reliable assessment of gross motor performance for children with ASD.",

In a large adult cohort (n = 209), TVPS-Figure Ground scores were positively correlated with autistic-like social features as assessed by the Broader autism phenotype questionnaire. This relationship was gender-specific, with males showing a correspondence between visual perceptual skills and autistic-like traits. This work supports the link between atypical visual perception and autism and highlights the importance in characterizing meaningful individual differences in clinically relevant behavioral phenotypes.",

Even with such a notable rate, there continues to be minimal research on the classroom strategy needs to support these students. While research may focus on each disability separately, it is necessary to remain diligent in employing strategies that consider both disabilities to be effective. The purpose of this qualitative multi-case study was to identify the practices being utilized by certified teachers of students with visual impairments as they provide instruction to students with this comorbid disability. Purposeful sampling was conducted to identify participants who were teachers of the visually impaired and had some training in autism spectrum disorders, and who had served students with autism and visual impairments for at least a year. Semi-structured interviews, participant completed observation guides, and artifact collection were utilized to gather data. Data were analyzed with both hand-coding and NVivo software. Seven main themes and two subthemes were identified during the data analysis. Participants' responses documented modifications across four categories, including predictability, tactile/tangible supports, social learning, specialized instructional planning, and consideration of research-based practices within their classroom management decisions. Recommendations encompassed modified instructional planning, predictability, the use of tactile/tangible supports, and social learning opportunities. Predictable classrooms, both in the physical and psychosocial sense, and social learning, meet the needs of both disabilities. Tactile/tangible supports allow educators to adapt visual research-based supports and modified instructional planning to ensure teachers can account for all learning styles. Recommendations for future research include the evaluation of strategies used across a wider participation pool and increased research on comprehensive classroom practices.

This study used a concurrent multiple baseline design across four participants to assess the presence of a functional relation between introduction of the Contextual Fit Enhancement Protocol, an intervention designed to improve contextual fit, and (a) an increase in fidelity of support plan implementation and (b) improved student behavior. Results indicate that following implementation of the Contextual Fit Enhancement Protocol, support plan implementation fidelity increased and student problem behavior decreased. In addition, teachers participating in the study rated the contextual fit intervention process as effective and efficient. Limitations and implications for future research, practice, and training are discussed.",

Three teaching staff (two teachers and one instructional aide) and three students with autism spectrum disorders participated in the study. The study examined the degree to which the classroom staff implemented the PTR intervention plan with fidelity and its impact on the students' behaviors, using a multiple baseline across participants design. The results indicated that the teaching staff implemented the PTR intervention plan with high levels of fidelity, and their implementation of the intervention plan led to decreases in problem behavior and increases in replacement behavior across all three participating students with ASD. The PTR-SEC teams found the PTR-SEC intervention to be acceptable and satisfactory; all three staff expressed interest in continuing to implement the PTR intervention plan after completion of the study.

      "abstract": "This monograph discusses development and implementation of positive behavioral intervention plans with students who have emotional and/or behavioral disorders. It focuses on four steps of a 10-step methodology using functional behavioral assessment and intervention. Emphasis is on the use of positive behavioral intervention plans and supports as encouraged by the 1997 Amendments to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. A rationale for this approach is offered which focuses on the need to understand the function of an inappropriate behavior and to replace it with a suitable behavior that serves the same function. This guide details the following steps: (1) develop and implement a behavioral intervention plan (including plan elements, strategies to address behavior  functions, student supports, and reinforcement); (2) monitor faithfulness of implementation of the plan; (3) evaluate effectiveness of the behavioral intervention plan; and (4) modify the behavioral intervention plan. It also briefly addresses obstacles to effective functional behavioral assessment and behavioral intervention plans and supports. Four appendices include: a functional assessment/behavioral intervention checklist; a positive behavioral intervention plan planning form; a forced-choice reinforcement menu; and a sample crisis/emergency plan.

However, very few studies have been undertaken to examine the effectiveness of the functional assessment-based behavioral plans with high school students in alternative settings. In this study, we present a case study of a high school student with behavior disorders attending an alternative school. First, we conducted indirect and direct functional assessments to identify the functions of the problem behaviors. Next, using a &quot;competing behavior model&quot; we developed a multi-component behavior intervention plan based on the functional assessment data. The effectiveness of the intervention plan, limitations, and implications for practice are discussed. (Contains 6 figures.)",

This paper presents suggestions on ways to accomplish this through data collection, design of an intervention, staff training, modifying an intervention, and teamwork. To illustrate the process, the paper describes a case study of a child in nursery school who was identified as having developmental problems. Traditional interventions and even consultations did not work with the child, so an intensive intervention, using a team approach, was initiated. First a baseline of behavior was established, and then the intervention plan was developed. The plan called for time-out procedures combined with a high rate of reinforcement  and a change in antecedents. The school psychologist met with teachers and staff to discuss the intervention and to train them in its implementation. After beginning the plan, staff met continuously to monitor progress and to adjust the interventions to address new behaviors. The intervention resulted in a steep decline in aggressive behaviors and in noncompliance. Verbal threats were extinguished and affectionate behavior increased dramatically. Plans for long-term maintenance as the child moved to higher grades were also implemented. (RJM)",

      "abstract": "According to federal mandates, if a student's behavior impedes their learning or the learning of others, the individualized education program team is required to address this with a functional behavioral assessment (FBA). The intent of the FBA is to determine the function, or reason, of the impeding behavior for the development of a behavioral intervention plan (BIP). The BIP process is a team-based approach that includes goals and interventions that result in positive behavior change. Procedural fidelity, or compliance with the plan, is of utmost importance to success of this process. Unfortunately, such integrity is often lacking, particularly when teachers carry the responsibility of implementing BIPs in the classroom. Therefore, capacity building within the school team is imperative to increase implementation fidelity of BIPs. This article provides practitioners with the tools to organize the monitoring and implementation of BIPs in classroom settings.",

      "abstract": "Although assistive technology has been an essential component of the academic success of students with disabilities, it is inconsistently implemented. Educators' perceptions of assistive technology training substantially impact the learning results of students with disabilities. The problem addressed by this study was that special education teachers are not properly trained to select and use assistive technology to improve the learning outcomes of students with disabilities. This issue affects both educators and students with disabilities. This qualitative case study was designed to investigate how middle school special education teachers utilize assistive technology training to influence student-learning results. Nine middle school special education teachers participated. A semi-structured interview and a focus group protocol included questions about how teachers use assistive technology training to impact student learning outcomes. The study's results indicated that students with disabilities thrive when assistive technology is applied effectively. It was recommended that special education teachers receive the proper training on assistive technology. Future research should focus on whether or not assistive technology creates a dependency for students with disabilities and the pre-service and professional development that special education teachers receive on assistive technology.&amp;#xa0; [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

      "title": "The Integration of Assistive Technology by Female In-Service Teachers of Students with Learning Disabilities in Saudi Arabia: A Qualitative Interview Study",
      "abstract": "The aim of this study is to explore the teachers' perceptions of integrating assistive technology into the curriculum for students with learning disabilities in Saudi Arabia. It is known that teaching students with learning disabilities had been one of the significant difficulties in the past and nowadays. Therefore, integrating assistive technology into the educational process would make it easier for the teachers of students with learning disabilities to teach these students through the use of integrating assistive technology. The use of such assistive technologies will be beneficial for learning disabilities students as well. The main question guiding this research is: &quot;What are the perceptions of in-service Learning disabilities teachers in Saudi Arabia about integrating assistive technology into the curriculum for students with LD?&quot; Past research has been done to show that the teachers' perceptions of using different methods for educating are acceptable and are helping in guaranteeing that teachers of students with learning disabilities can learn the best ways to teach students with disabilities. One of the encouraging teaching techniques is using assistive technology into the curriculum of learning disabilities (Nabavi-Pelesarael et al, 2018). This study has adapted a qualitative interview research design to understand the perceptions of seven female in-service teachers of students with learning disabilities in Saudi Arabia regarding of integrating assistive technology. After analyzing data from seven elementary special education teachers, several key themes were uncovered. First, teachers showed a high level of preparation with technology, which was driven by training received from the Ministry of Education, participation in conferences and workshops, and teachers' readiness for technology use. As such, the findings of this study demonstrate the critical role that teacher training plays in reinforcing student-centered learning through assistive technology. Training not only equips teachers with technical knowhow of using assistive technological devices, but it also contributes to the readiness for technology use in all aspects of learning and curriculum development. Second, teachers interviewed in this study showed a high frequency of technology use with a majority of the respondents indicating they used technological tools either on a daily basis or occasionally. The factors that promoted technology integration were identified as the availability of devices such as projectors and teachers' readiness for technology use. Hence, support in form of technological infrastructure could be a key factor in influencing the outcomes of assistive technology in the classroom. The study shows the need for ensuring a balance between the physical infrastructure and the social aspects of personnel management in ensuring the success of technology integration in elementary education. In this study, several criteria were identified as playing a role in integrating assistive technology in the curricula for students with learning disabilities. These factors included the teachers' discretion, age of students, ease of technology use, and existence of strategies for keeping up with assistive learning technologies. The integration for integrating assistive technology in curricula for students with learning disabilities was found to be influenced by the existence of technologies such as smart devices and interactive interfaces. However, connectivity issues, lack of appropriate technology, and lack of support from the school hindered the integration process. Moreover, this study demonstrated the familiarity of teachers with technology integration standards. Teachers viewed assistive technology integration as an important tool for teaching students with learning disabilities as well as improving learning outcomes. Overall, the findings of this study demonstrate the prominent roles played by technological infrastructure and teacher training in promoting and sustaining the use of assistive technology for students with learning disabilities.

      "abstract": "As early as 1988, the United States federal government mandated the creation of formal and informal programs to increase acquisition of assistive technology by persons with disabilities, with a special attention to underrepresented groups. This study compared the methods used by Hispanics with disabilities to learn about assistive technology with Whites and non-Whites. The study is the combination of the national study and a targeted study of Hispanics, due to this group' s lower representation in the national sample. This study sought to answer the following questions: (I) Are there intergroup differences between Hispanics with disabilities and non-Hispanics with disabilities in terms of how they learn about assistive technology, and (2) are there intragroup differences among Hispanics' actions on how they learn about assistive technology? Findings indicated that regardless of ethnic/racial group, most individuals with disabilities learn about assistive technology through doctors or other medical professionals. However, some differences were found on the use of extended family, friends, and neighbors and the Internet as other methods to learn about assistive technology. Additionally, the Hispanics from the national sample appear more aligned with the overall sample, while the Hispanics from the Hispanic-only sample seem to be using services at higher percentages.",

Research supporting their connection with learning disabilities is reviewed. In addition, three examples of interventions that are comprehensive and link academic and social-emotional learning are presented. The first is from language arts. The others are pedagogical procedures that draw upon the multiple intelligences to assist students with tasks such as projects or reports and working through academic and social challenges.",

From the articles identified for initial review (n = 4,355), 166 met the inclusionary criteria. Among these, 19 studies explicitly mentioned including students with disabilities. Five studies included analyses of students with disabilities as a subgroup, with varying results. Additional analyses focus on evidence of attention to varied learning needs in curricular materials or training of facilitators. Findings demonstrate scant attention to students with disabilities in reports of universal SEL interventions, leaving open questions about their inclusion and effects of participation. Opportunities for addressing these questions in future research are described.",

Early social emotional difficulties may indicate an early mental health condition, developmental delays, or educational disabilities. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (2004) includes provisions for finding and supporting young children with delays or disabilities associated with social emotional needs. Yet, few young children are identified and connected to services, suggesting identification challenges. We used survey methodology to learn about social emotional evaluation practices used by Child Find teams in Colorado for children evaluated for early intervention and preschool special education eligibility. Results suggested that Child Find professionals relied heavily on observations, parent report, and teacher/caregiver input when determining social emotional eligibility. Fewer providers used standardized screening and validated social emotional tools. While most providers made decisions aligned with Colorado eligibility, others appeared to misunderstand the criteria. Implications and future directions are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Numerous studies have demonstrated that social and emotional skills (SE skills) can predict academic achievement, including grades and test scores, and prior research at ACT has shown that stronger SE skills are associated with higher ACT scores. However, despite the abundant evidence that SE skills are beneficial for students in general, less is known about the relationship between SE skills and academic achievement among students with disabilities, who make up approximately 15% of all public school students (National Center for Education Statistics, 2023). In this study, the relationship between SE skills and ACT scores among students with and without disabilities was examined. Using data from the Mosaic\u2122 by ACT\u00ae Social and Emotional Learning assessment, two matched groups of 410 students each were created, one whose members had disabilities and one whose members did not. Findings show a positive relationship between SE skills and ACT Composite scores in both students with disabilities and students without disabilities.",

      "title": "Experiencing Postsecondary Transition Planning: The Perspective of Students with Moderate Special Needs",
      "abstract": "Special educators must engage students with special needs in transition planning to help students set and achieve goals with regard to postsecondary education, vocation, community engagement, and independent living. Researchers have examined many aspects of transition planning, but few have examined how students with special needs experience the transition process and the outcome of transition. It is important to examine the student perspective to fill a gap in the literature, to enable schools to develop more effective transition planning services, and to provide these students with a voice. This study used a phenomenological approach to fulfill these goals by examining how students with moderate special needs disabilities describe their experience of planning for and pursuing transition goals, what influenced and affected them in the process, and what the initial outcome of their transition has been. The researcher purposefully sampled six former high school students with moderate special needs disabilities. The data for analysis emerged from in-depth, semi-structured, individual interviews. Using a strategy of open coding, the researcher analyzed and reduced the data to textural and structural descriptions, revealing the essence of transition for students with moderate special needs disabilities. The findings suggest that the nature of participant interaction with special education teachers within a specific high school setting affects the participants' experience of transition planning and the initial outcome of their transition. Improving transition planning requires understanding how student interaction at the individual, classroom, and school levels affects whether students acquire the skills and attributes needed to make a successful postsecondary transition.

Factor analysis of the 427 responses revealed that special educators differed from administrators and related service personnel in their perceptions of transition planning. Special educators perceived lower levels of student involvement and provision of fewer services and activities related to self-reliance than did the other two groups. Special educators also desired greater provision of services to foster career/vocational goals in transition planning than the other two groups. Team  members from all three groups desired a greater degree of student involvement in transition planning and related services and activities than currently exists. Findings suggest that professionals perceive \"best practices\" as described in the transition literature to be desirable program elements for students with learning disabilities.

      "title": "Building Special Educator Capacity for Transition Planning: An Action Research Study",
      "abstract": "At the researcher's local level, comprehensive transition planning on the part of secondary special education teachers has historically been lacking. There have been several cases that went to litigation over transition planning issues. The district received a citation from the Connecticut State Department of Education for the school year 2020-2021, because the district was out of compliance for transition in the Individualized Education Plans. The purpose of this Action Research study was: 1. To determine if targeted secondary level transition professional development improved the student planning practices of secondary special education teachers in the researcher's district. The targeted professional development focused on training middle and high school special educators to embed Person-Centered Planning transition activities into their practice. 2. To determine which aspects of the professional development training have the greatest impacts on learning. Qualitative thematic coding created categories and themes. Results from the Secondary Teachers Transition Survey indicated that special education teachers felt unprepared in all of the 46 competency areas. Conclusions were that veteran and new special education teachers did not feel prepared to implement comprehensive transition planning, and were not satisfied with the level of training they had received prior to the intervention. Interview results presented an overarching theme of a lack of time to implement comprehensive transition planning activities, or to work through resources even when they were provided. Recommendations include consistent and regular professional development training in the area of transition, and access to materials online.

Meeting three focuses on parental responsibilities to: communicate information about the child to teachers, assess the child's readiness for kindergarten, be aware of possible transition problems and their solutions, and observe various program options to determine the best choice for their child. The fourth meeting concentrates on developing an effective home-school partnership, with tips for working cooperatively.

      "title": "High School Special Educators&apos; Perceptions of the Transition Planning Process to Prepare Students with Disabilities for Postsecondary Life",
      "abstract": "Students with disabilities in the United States continue to encounter less than favorable success in employment and education after high school. Only 35% of students with disabilities graduating from high school have workforce skills. The purpose of this basic qualitative study was to investigate high school special educators' perceptions of the transition planning process for students with disabilities in preparation for postsecondary life. The conceptual framework was Schlossberg's transition theory and Kohler's taxonomy for transition programming 2.0 model. The research questions focused on the types of transition planning practices that are currently being used by high school special education teachers and how these teachers evaluate the sufficiency of the transition process. Purposeful sampling was used in this study. Through semistructured interviews, qualitative data were collected from 10 high school special education teachers with at least one year of experience working with transition plans and the planning process to support students with disabilities. Open coding and thematic analysis revealed five themes: assessment, barriers, training, programs, and support. Findings revealed that connections between transition predictors for postschool success and secondary transition evidence-based practices were missing in the transition process. Also, special educators needed training in program creation, and evaluation, through professional development, in the field. The implication for positive social change is that special education teachers who use effective transition planning consistently can enrich educational decision-making practices that support students with disabilities so they can achieve long-term success, improving their post school outcomes.

      "abstract": "Because of the important role secondary special educators have in the transition to adulthood of adolescents with disabilities, it behooves educators to have an understanding of human development. The lifespan perspective on human development is particularly relevant to transition planning. Individuals with a lifespan perspective believe development to be lifelong, multidimensional, multidirectional, and plastic (Baltes, Reese, &amp; Lipsitt, 1980). By viewing transition planning through a lifespan developmental lens, educators are able to enhance the transition process and more comprehensively prepare their students with disabilities for adulthood. This article describes how the lifespan perspective impacts transition planning and provides an illustration of how a special education teacher can use this framework to develop a student's transition portions of the Individualized Education Program.",

It presents the vision of transition planning in Texas, the state of practice as reflected in a study of 27 students, and conclusions and recommendations. The transition planning vision calls for planning at the state, regional/local, and individual levels to enable all people to choose where to live, work, and play; to make informed choices and have control over their lives; to participate in their community; and to be responsive to change. The study assessed awareness of transition planning and the Individualized Transition Plan (ITP), school staff training, parental involvement, community-based educational training/work sites,  program organization and resource allocation, ITP meetings and participants, transition planning outcome goals, relationships with agencies, barriers to effective planning, and value of transition planning. Recommendations call for: student, parent, and school staff training; greater involvement of students in transition planning; development of strategies to compensate for lack of parental involvement; greater attention to recreation and leisure activities; increased emphasis on development of social networks; moving from paper compliance to outcome-based planning; allocation of school funding to support transition planning and services; and need for schools to build connections with local communities and develop an array of options for community participation.

      "abstract": "The Voices of Secondary Special Education Teachers in Transition Planning Students with disabilities appear to be graduating without acquiring the necessary skills prior to graduating from high school and transitioning to the adult role expectations of pursuing postsecondary education, furthering vocational training, or entering into the world of work and living independently. This may be due to the inadequate training and lack of self-efficacy of special education teachers. Without sufficient and adequate transition planning services and the guidance of confident special education teachers who are knowledgeable with effective transition planning skills, secondary students with disabilities will not be prepared for life after high school. This basic interpretive qualitative study sought to understand and explain how special education teachers interpret their experiences with transition planning, what their experiences with transition planning means in the world of special education, and how this study may have further implications for practice. Interviews were used to examine teachers' perceptions in the areas of: (a) transition knowledge and planning; (b) self-determination/self-advocacy; and (c) collaboration. This study's participants consisted of 19 purposefully selected, secondary special education teachers of students with disabilities, receiving special education services within a school district in the northern most point in Virginia. The data analysis reinforced earlier studies that some special education teachers felt they lacked self-efficacy and did not feel prepared to plan and provide transition services to students with disabilities. They perceived they were well-prepared to deliver the necessary services in the area of curriculum and instruction, but felt unprepared and lacked self-confidence in their abilities due to their own lack of educational training. The findings in this study provided aspects from special education teachers who have valuable information to share regarding their perceptions of transition planning which can be used by special education teachers, administrators, guidance counselors, district leaders, transition specialist, and university systems to evaluate their current practices. As well as, for a student with a disability, leaving school without the skills to gain competitive employment or attend college will continue to distance them from their peers, this is why continued research in this area is important.

      "title": "Embedding Positive Behavior Intervention and Supports in Afterschool Programs",
      "abstract": "There is growing recognition that after-school programs (ASPs) provide opportunities for positive youth development. Many ASPs focus on behavior and socio-emotional challenges, provide evidence-based interventions to improve homework completion and academic skills, and offer physical activities and nutritious foods. Generally speaking, ASPs offer a critical service to families by providing safe environments for students during ''risky'' after-school hours. These programs have an opportunity to reap many benefits by utilizing evidence-based education initiatives, such as positive behavior interventions and supports (PBIS), to promote a positive environment, support participant and staff behavior, and enhance outcomes. In support of extending PBIS into ASPs, this paper includes an overview of PBIS, specifies its relevance to ASPs, outlines initial research support, and reviews considerations related to preparation, implementation, and evaluation of PBIS in ASPs. Considerations for embedding PBIS into ASPs during preparation, implementation, and evaluation are provided.",

Two primary research questions were addressed: (a) Are measures of teacher use of classroom-wide positive behavior intervention and support (PBIS) strategies associated with the quality of teacher language support? and (b) Do teachers who receive program-wide training in PBIS strategies differ in their language interactions with children in their classrooms compared with a control group? Findings were mixed and provide preliminary support for the hypothesis that a positive relationship exists between PBIS strategies and the language-learning environment of preschool classrooms. Teachers' scores on a measure of PBIS strategies were a significant predictor of global ratings of language support. However, teachers who were enrolled in the program-wide PBIS training group did not score significantly higher than teachers in a control group at posttest.",

      "title": "Teachers&apos; Perception of the Positive Behavior Interventions and Support (PBIS) Program in a High-Needs Elementary School in Maryland",
      "abstract": "Student behavior within our school system has been and still is an area of concern. There are many different approaches to maintaining a healthy and safe culture for learning. Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS) programs can have a powerful impact on schools. No matter the goal of the PBIS program, a school's climate and culture can have a profound impact on student achievement and behavior (Harte-Weiner, 2016). The school culture is primarily determined by the values, shared beliefs, and behaviors of all stakeholders within the school community and is reflected in the school's social norms (Harte-Weiner, 2016).This research focused on a schoolwide program known as Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS), which seeks to reduce or eliminate poor behavior schoolwide by encouraging positive behaviors and teachers' perceptions in a high-needs elementary school in Maryland. PBIS is a national evidence-based framework for schools to adopt and use to help them design, implement, and teach behavior practices for students. The goal of PBIS is to create a positive school climate in which students can learn and grow (PBIS Rewards, 2021a; Responsive Classroom, 2021). The premise of this approach is that continual teaching, modeling, and reinforcing positive behaviors will support children's positive behaviors, reducing discipline problems, and promote a climate of greater productivity, safety, and learning (Responsive Classroom, 2021). The purpose of this study was to analyze teachers' perceptions at a high-needs elementary school in Maryland on the Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS) program implementation and its effectiveness of primary interventions on student behaviors. PBIS began during the 2018-2019 school; however, full implementation did not occur until 2019-2020. Data collection would help determine recommendations to improve the implementation of PBIS and teachers' buy-in. PBIS SAS was used as well as interviews of selected participants to obtain the teacher perception in a high needs school in Maryland.

One technique schools utilize to teach and reinforce behavioral expectations is through the use of video. Since 2010, the Association for Positive Behavior Support has hosted the PBIS Film Festival at the annual meeting to showcase schools' use of video with 56 videos entered in the PBIS Film Festival in 2017. Despite the current utilization of videos as a means to sustain and/or support PBIS initiatives, the supports for creating and procedures for disseminating videos remain unclear. The purpose of this qualitative collective case study was to gain an understanding of how schools are creating (e.g., resources, administration commitment) and utilizing (i.e., screening) PBIS videos. Interviews were conducted with 14 PBIS film creators who submitted videos to the 2017 annual PBIS Film Festival. Analysis revealed themes surrounding the development and use of PBIS videos.

However, research suggests students with complex support needs have limited access to Tier 1 PBIS. Teachers' perceptions of the appropriateness of PBIS to meet the needs of students with complex support needs has been hypothesized to impact the extent to which educators provide access to Tier 1. Using data from a national survey of 644 educators, we sought to determine the extent to which educational placement of students with complex support needs impacted teacher perception of the importance of providing Tier 1 PBIS. Our results suggest educators across placements agree students with complex support needs should be involved in PBIS, including acknowledgment systems and response and data plans. Educators differed in their ideas of how to teach school-wide rules and expectations and how to document behavioral violations. We discuss implications of these findings for research and practice.",

      "abstract": "Exploring Teachers' Perceptions of Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS) and Its Impact on Student Academic Achievement in Elementary Schools&quot; investigates the gap in understanding how elementary teachers perceive PBIS's effectiveness in boosting student academic performance amidst behavioral challenges. This phenomenological qualitative research study delves into teachers' lived experiences with PBIS to evaluate its impact on student behavior and academic success. Grounded in transcendental phenomenology, it aims to uncover the essence of educators' interactions with PBIS, shedding light on its influence on both student achievement and educator support for the program within the educational environment. Data were collected from fifteen experienced elementary teachers through structured interviews and a Qualtrics survey over 13 weeks. These educators, with 4 to 12 years of PBIS implementation experience, provided insights into their attitudes towards PBIS via one-on-one virtual interviews and online surveys. Thematic analysis of interview data and statistical analysis of survey responses identified patterns in teachers' perceptions of PBIS. Findings indicate a positive view of PBIS among most teachers, recognizing its effectiveness in managing classroom behavior and indirectly enhancing academic achievement. However, challenges in addressing severe behavioral issues were noted, with calls for increased support, training, and consistency in implementation. The study concludes that PBIS's success hinges on comprehensive training and consistent application across all intervention tiers. Future research should explore PBIS strategies targeting severe behavioral challenges to ensure a holistic approach to improving student behavior and academic outcomes.

      "abstract": "This study examines whether Positive Behavior Interventions can support student performance in schools in three Southern districts. Schools today seek opportunities for interventions to support student behaviors and increase engagement. Three school districts in the southeast of the United States have been trained to implement a schoolwide Positive Behavior Interventions and Support (PBIS) framework to mitigate challenging behaviors that lead to out-of-school suspensions. The following research questions drive this qualitative research: (1) What impact did PBIS have on the number of out-of-school suspensions in three southern public-school districts? (2) What are teachers' perceptions about the implementation of PBIS? This mixed-method study collects data through publicly available discipline data from three public school districts in the southern region and online surveys distributed to teachers who are implementing PBIS in these same districts.

      "abstract": "Universal Design for Learning (UDL) emerged from the field of architectural design when  federal legislation required universal access to buildings and other structures for individuals with disabilities. Architects began to design accessibility into buildings during their initial design stage rather than retrofitting standing structures. Using this architectural principle, UDL is a strategy to eliminate barriers that students may encounter to learning. Universal Design for Learning was a term coined by the Center for Accessing Special Technologies (CAST). UDL includes Universally Designed Instruction (UDI) as well as the concept of universally designed curriculum (UDC) and Universal Design in Assessment (UDA). Each of these concepts deals with the idea that education, in general, should be designed up front for access by all students, whether the curriculum, the instructional strategies, or the assessment. This document examines: (1) what UDL is and is not; (2) UDL & the link to the brain; (3) benefits of universal design; (4) UDL lessons learned; (5) implications for teachers; (6) implementation of UDL; and (7) UDL resources.",

The eight chapters address the following topics: (1) &quot;Education in the Digital Age;&quot; (2) &quot;What Brain Research Tells Us about Learner Differences;&quot; (3) &quot;Why We Need Flexible Instructional Media;&quot; (4) &quot;What Is Universal Design for Learning?;&quot; (5) &quot;Using UDL To Set Clear Goals;&quot; (6) &quot;Using UDL To Support Every Student's Learning;&quot; (7) &quot;Using UDL To Accurately Assess Student Progress;&quot; and (8) &quot;Making Universal Design for Learning a Reality&quot;. An  appendix offers four classroom templates to help teachers apply the UDL framework. The templates address: a class learning profile, curriculum barriers, UDL solutions, and creating systematic change. Each template includes an introduction and three parts: an example of how the template might be used, collected sample items to use in the blank template, and a framework for applying UDL.

      "abstract": "Universal Design for Learning (UDL) stands at the forefront of contemporary efforts to create universal access to educational curricula for all students, including those with disabilities. The &quot;universal&quot; in UDL does not mean there is a single optimal solution for everyone. Instead, it underscores the need for flexible approaches to teaching and learning that meet the needs of different kinds of learners. In this first UDL Reader, Anne Meyer and David H. Rose, cofounders of CAST, the educational nonprofit that developed the UDL framework, bring together a collection of articles on the practical, classroom dimensions of the UDL revolution in education. The authors offer insights on learner differences, the capacities of new media in the classroom, and effective teaching and assessment practices. The volume also includes lessons from teacher professional development workshops, classroom-based research, and UDL practitioners themselves. A highly readable volume aimed particularly at school teachers and administrators, this book is also an uncommonly accessible introduction to UDL for all readers committed to creating improved and universal access to educational materials for all students. Following a preface (Anne Meyer and David H. Rose), this book contains the following chapters: (1) Applying Universal Design for Learning in the Classroom (Peggy Coyne, Patricia Ganley, Tracey Hall, Grace Meo, Elizabeth Murray, and David Gordon); (2) A UDL Case Story and Model Lesson: Reading Challenges in Geography and Social Studies (The Staff at CAST); (3) Frequent Questions about Universal Design for Learning (Grace Meo); (4) A Level Playing Field: UDL in the Classroom (Lani Harac); (5) Teacher Perspectives: UDL in the Elementary Classroom (Kirsten Lee Howard); (6) Teacher Perspectives: Strategy Instruction Goes Digital (Nicole Strangman); (7) Implications of Universal Design for Learning for Classroom Assessment (David H. Rose and Robert P. Dolan); (8) The Promise of New Learning Environments for Students with Disabilities (Bart Pisha and Skip Stahl); (9) Transforming the Textbook to Improve Learning (Skip Stahl); (10) Engaging the Text: Brain Research and the Universal Design of Reading Strategy Supports (David H. Rose and Bridget Dalton); and (11) Teaching Internet Literacy Strategies: The Hero Inquiry Project (Maya B. Eagleton, Kathleen Guinee, and Karen Langlais). An index is also included.",

The UDL framework provides teachers with a unified framework to collaborate on the development of an accessible and inclusive curriculum through flexible pedagogy and tool use. Developed for all students, the UDL framework aims to expand all teachers' expertise in teaching diverse learners and depends on collaboration for success. The article explores the following essential questions about the UDL collaboration process: What are the necessary steps in the collaboration? Who are key players and contributors? What does the UDL collaboration model entail for the key players?

      "abstract": "The construct of Universal Design (UD) has been used in a number of fields such as engineering and architecture to design and produce products and services that are usable by people with a wide variety of characteristics. The field of UD supports a framework that can also be used to enhance the field of education. A number of constructs have been established that have as their goal the improvement of learning environments to benefit people with a wide range of characteristics. One model is called Universal Design for Instruction (UDI) and another one is Universal Design for Learning (UDL). This article investigates whether the application of the UDL construct will influence the design of technology-enhanced courses. The UDL construct's goal is to create flexible learning environments that can reduce learning barriers and support the needs of a wide range of learners. The authors discuss how UDL learning principles and options are used in technology-enhanced courses. Using UDL principles, technology-enhanced course design is an effective way to create flexible learning environments for learners. This format adds a philosophical structure to technology-enhanced courses that can change the education landscape and create a more dynamic learning experience for all involved.",

The Universal Design for Learning (UDL) framework can be used to create inclusive learning materials and activities in the higher education science classroom. A UDL Academy introduced science faculty to the UDL framework, which led to them implementing UDL in their classes. A chemistry and physics professor and an environmental science and biology professor participated in the UDL Academy during summer 2021 and implemented UDL in at least one course during the fall 2021 semester. They share their perspectives on the UDL implementations and implications for college science teaching.",

To do so, the author first defines Universal Design for Learning and then attends briefly to contemporary English studies research on UDL. The author next analyzes different ways she integrates it in her first-year composition course; then, she discusses some of the complications instructors may encounter trying to implement these strategies. The author argues that although UDL cannot ensure universal student success, the pedagogical practice fosters an inclusive classroom that makes it more likely that higher numbers of students will not only succeed, but also learn in ways that best suit them.",

The implementation and use of RtI was predicted to be dependent upon those variables. In this study, 247 school psychologists from Minnesota and Wisconsin were asked to complete a 32-item email survey pertaining to RtI. The results of the study showed that as school psychologists' knowledge of RtI increased, as district opportunities for RtI training increased, and when school psychologists' attitudes were positive, RtI was more often implemented. &quot;The School Psychologist's Role of Response to Intervention (RtI): Factors That  Influence RtI Implementation&quot; Survey is appended.

The Teacher Efficacy Belief and Behavior Scale-TEBBS (Nunn, 1998), was administered at the completion of a year-long, 5 day training experience, integrated with school-based assignments and on-site followup. Analysis revealed main effects upon teacher efficacy measures of Intervention Skills Efficacy (ISE) and Motivation Skills Efficacy (MSE), but did not for External Control Efficacy (ECE). Post hoc means revealed higher efficacy beliefs and behaviors associated with higher levels of RtI-INV and RtI-IMP. Implications are discussed relative to ongoing teacher efficacy and RtI research.

Most advanced are RTI programs in elementary schools, with preschool and secondary education programs beginning to discuss, develop, and experiment with schoolwide RTI. At its heart, RTI seeks to account for individual differences in student learning success by discovering the instructional situations in which each student learns best and providing them for all who need them. RTI is an early intervention approach to the prevention of learning and behavior problems before they become disabilities. The implementation of schoolwide RTI approaches reorganizes school ecology at multiple levels. When implemented with fidelity, RTI schools have a distinctive &quot;ecological footprint&quot; that differentiates them from traditional, non-RTI schools. Implementers of RTI need consultation that provides them with information on the structure and function of their programs for use in problem solving and decision making. The purpose of this article is to describe RTI and illustrate an ecobehavioral approach to providing RTI school staff with information they need. (Contains 4 tables and 2 figures.)",

RtI also allows school districts to use an alternative method for identifying students with disabilities, but there is a paucity of published empirical research aimed to inform RtI best practices among general educators. The purpose of this paper was to systematically review empirical RtI research with regard to research dissemination and specific foundational components. Specifically, 47 peer-reviewed articles describing policy, intervention, or tiered supports within RtI were reviewed for content related to the six foundational RtI components: (a) screening, (b) primary prevention, (c) secondary intervention, (d) tertiary intervention, (e) progress monitoring, and (f) multidisciplinary evaluation. The findings suggest most RtI research is conducted within the context of special education, and the subsequent articles are published in special education journals. Therefore, additional RtI research outlining evidence-based practices for the primary and secondary tiers of RtI need be disseminated to administrators and general educators, specifically focusing on all six implementation components.",

A major feature of this approach is the implementation of academic interventions in general education and measuring the student's response to those interventions.

This article reviews three studies of RTI that investigate the RTI tiers. Sharon Vaughn and Rollanda O'Connor report on studies using the Standard Protocol approach to RTI. David Tilly reports on using the Problem Solving Model as an RTI model. This article summarizes the results of these three investigations.",

Despite its wide use, there is limited research regarding school psychologists' graduate preparation in and familiarity with RTI for SLD identification. This study examined how school psychologists' graduate preparation in RTI, use of RTI in practice, and preference for RTI in SLD identification impacted SLD identification consistency using RTI. Participants included 110 school psychologists who were recruited from state school psychology associations. Participants viewed RTI SLD identification criteria and student evaluation data and then made an SLD identification decision. Results showed that participants' graduate preparation in RTI, use of RTI in regular district practice, and preference for RTI for SLD identification did not increase the likelihood of consistent SLD identification using RTI. Implications for practice and training in RTI for SLD identification are discussed.",

Chapter 1 discusses federal requirements for functional assessments and the need for educators to understand functional assessment. Chapter 2 explains a team approach to functional assessment, when to conduct a functional assessment, and who should conduct the assessment. The following chapter describes a 10-step procedure for conducting functional assessments in schools: identify  the student's behavior, describe the problem behavior, collect behavioral baseline data and academic information, describe the environment and setting demands, complete the Functional Assessment Interview Form, develop a hypothesis, write a behavioral intervention plan, implement the behavioral intervention plan, collect behavioral data, and conduct a follow-up team meeting. The final chapter discusses writing a behavior intervention plan, selecting appropriate interventions, and implementing the plan. Appendices include a target behavioral assessment form, data collection forms, a student interview form, and other assessment forms. (Contains 30 references.) (CR)",

In this article we discuss how special and general education teachers are prepared to assess students when they struggle academically, but are not typically prepared to assess students when they struggle behaviorally. Research shows little consensus about whether teachers can effectively conduct functional behavior assessments while attending to their responsibilities in the classroom. One argument is that the complexity of the process may be prohibitive for teachers to conduct valid functional behavior assessments on their own. Others argue that with training and support, teachers can effectively use functional behavior assessment to address behavior in their classrooms. In this article, three educators (two teachers and a behavior specialist) who have been taught to complete functional behavior assessment give their perspectives on teachers' use of functional behavior assessment in the classroom.",

Moreover, limited studies have used functional assessment procedures with the class as the unit of analysis. This study included functional analyses and a function-based differential reinforcement procedure for 2 preschool classrooms referred for behavioral consultation services because multiple students were engaging in disruptive behavior. Results indicated that function-based differential reinforcement interventions resulted in reductions in children's disruptive behavior and teachers rated assessment and intervention procedures as acceptable. The authors discuss the results in terms of functional assessment and function-based intervention research and practice in preschool classrooms. (Contains 2 figures.)",

However, fewer studies have been conducted with preschool students who exhibit high incidence problem behaviors. The current study includes data from comprehensive functional assessments and interventions implemented in preschool and Head Start classrooms. Three preschool students and five teachers participated in the study. Each student received a comprehensive functional assessment for problem behavior that included a teacher interview, descriptive assessment, and abbreviated functional analysis. Assessment data were used to develop individualized function-based interventions that were implemented by experimenters and teachers. The function-based interventions resulted in decreases in problem behavior for all three students. Additionally, convergence between functional assessment procedures was obtained for all participants. Finally, social validity data indicated that teachers found the assessment and intervention procedures acceptable.",

One is the comparison of different types of functional assessment (e.g., experimental functional analysis and non-experimental functional assessment). The current study aims to compare the different methodologies of functional assessment and their effectiveness in ascribing function to a target behavior and in the treatment selection that follows such an assessment. Quantitative synthesis data were used to answer questions regarding behavioral function, assessment type, and treatment effectiveness. Results indicate that assessment type can impact treatment effectiveness and that there is a relationship between behavior type and ascribed function.",

All behaviors are under stimulus control and research indicates that behaviors typically serve four functions: tangible, escape, attention, and automatic. However, when individuals with developmental disabilities engage in inappropriate sexual behaviors such as exposing their genitalia in public places or groping a stranger, it is not typical for practitioners to implement this functional behavior assessment process as these sexual behaviors are often viewed as different from non-sexual inappropriate behaviors like screaming in class or throwing school materials. This article presents information of how to complete a comprehensive functional behavior assessment for three students with developmental disabilities who exhibit sexually inappropriate behaviors in school settings to highlight the usefulness of the functional behavior assessment process for developing behavior intervention plans for long lasting behavior change.",

Functional assessment reports, prepared by 17 behavior analysts, were obtained on 174 individuals who presented with total of 536 challenging behaviors that were assessed separately. The most frequent topographical class of behavior was physical aggression, followed by verbal aggression, noncompliance, property destruction, inappropriate verbal and social behavior, and self-injury. Functional assessment yielded a single hypothesized function for 53.2% of all behaviors, but multiple functions for 41.0%. Attention was the most commonly hypothesized function for most topographies of behavior. This finding may be attributable to sample characteristics, or to the use of informant-based functional assessment methods for a majority of sample cases. (Contains 5 tables and 1 figure.)",

It shows how to conduct a functional assessment and link assessment results to interventions, and provides an example of a completed functional analysis. An introductory chapter identifies fundamental assumptions of functional assessment. Chapter 2 discusses conducting a functional assessment, with sections on identifying, prioritizing, and defining problem behaviors; formulating hypotheses; and completing a functional analysis. Periodic self-check sub-sections are also provided. Chapter 3 is on linking assessment  results to interventions. It covers selecting replacement behaviors, manipulating consequences, manipulating antecedents, and addressing setting events. Chapter 4 provides a detailed example of a completed functional assessment through the steps of identifying problem behaviors, prioritizing problem behaviors, defining problem behaviors, formulating hypotheses, and developing an intervention. The concluding chapter stresses application of an assessment process conducted through a combination of structured interviews, systematic observations, and functional analysis of problem behavior.

Functional assessment procedures included interview, observation, functional analysis, and intervention. Functional analysis conditions, conducted by the classroom teacher, with coaching from the researcher, indicated multiple functions for the behavior. Intervention consisted of teacher attention (praise) and points, and self-management of appropriate responses during group instruction. Intervention during independent seatwork consisted of modeling by the teacher to decrease task difficulty, the use of &quot;help tickets&quot; to request assistance from peers or the teacher, and social attention for task completion. Results indicated improved on-task and decreased disruptive behaviors during function-based intervention. The use of functional assessment in general education settings is discussed.
